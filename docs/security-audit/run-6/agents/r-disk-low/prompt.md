You are final record verifier `r-disk-low` in run-6 of a defensive security audit of agentbox. You did not hunt this candidate and you did not perform its Phase 3 validation. You check the STRUCTURED RECORD below, not anyone's write-up.

# Audited source and version

Read-only audited source: `<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/scratch/run6/src-audited/` — a git worktree of `main` at commit `530b29e`. Every path and line must exist in THAT tree (except `agents/...` artifacts which live under `<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-6/agents/...`).

# Phase 5 procedure (verbatim)

```text
### Phase 5: Verify the final records with fresh eyes

Launch one fresh `research` verifier per final `confirmed` and `needs_validation` record, in parallel. This verifier checks the structured record, not the hunter write-up, and remains inside source/local boundaries.

In a `quick` run, Phase 3 and Phase 5 merge: the Phase 3 verifier also performs these record checks and returns the final schema-shaped record, so each candidate gets one fresh independent reviewer instead of two. Every other profile keeps the two passes separate. Never skip independent review of a `confirmed` record in any profile.

For `confirmed`, require it to check:

1. Every repository-relative trace/evidence path, line, scope, and described operation.
2. Real entry interface and exact local input shape.
3. Every condition, parser/policy step, source-visible preventing layer, and observed local result.
4. Affected principal/resource and demonstrated impact.
5. Severity separation: realistic likelihood, demonstrated impact, overall no greater than impact.
6. Remediation strategy and any `code_changes`, including whether the fix enforces the invariant without merely moving trust.

For `needs_validation`, require it to check:

1. The source path is real and supports only the `claimed_root_cause` stated.
2. Every listed blocker is decisive and not already answerable locally.
3. The candidate names a boundary and a possible concrete result rather than a generic concern.
4. At least one validation-plan field is present and exact. `local` uses a bounded fixture; `deployment` asks an owner to observe a configuration, identity, route, policy, or runtime fact. Do not invent a plan for an inapplicable context, and never send audit traffic to a deployment.
5. The fingerprint matches prior/current records for the same root cause.

Each verifier returns exactly one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"..."}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`, with no surrounding prose. A replacement record must match its `confirmed`, `needs_validation`, or `rejected` schema branch. Treat a malformed or prose-wrapped Phase 5 result the same way as in Phase 3: discard it without repairing it and re-run with a fresh verifier when the budget permits.

Do not apply a Phase 5 replacement as final when it promotes a record to a stronger verdict, including any promotion to `confirmed`, or materially changes the root cause, trace, execution input or observed result, demonstrated impact, or severity. Give that complete replacement to a new independent verifier that did not hunt, perform Phase 3 validation, or propose the Phase 5 replacement. The new verifier rechecks the current source and independently reproduces any decisive local result under the execution boundary, then returns `verified` or another replacement. Apply a material replacement only after this fresh verification. If another material replacement results, repeat with a fresh verifier. If budget or independence is unavailable, remove the disputed record from `findings.json`, keep its ledger unit as an unresolved candidate, and set `run_status: "incomplete"` with an exact `incomplete_reason`. Non-material wording or repository-line corrections may be applied directly when they do not change meaning or evidence.

After every applied replacement, rerun both validators and update linked ledger decisions. If a final verifier identifies a separate root cause, assign a new fingerprint and send it through independent candidate validation before inclusion. Set `run_status: "complete"` only when every ledger candidate has an independent final disposition and every retained record passes Phase 5.

Do not verify only `confirmed` records. A misleading `needs_validation` handoff wastes owner time and can preserve a false premise.

# Architecture facts (summary; re-check every line you rely on)

# agentbox architecture summary (run-6)

Source ref: `530b29e` (`main`, after fix PRs #24 and #25). Profile `standard`, focused follow-up, budget 30 (all subagents `flash`). This file is the run-4/run-5 architecture plus a parent-written delta in section 0 covering every file changed since `346df29` (PRs #24 and #25: 13 non-test files in `agentbox/` and `deploy/`) and the run-5 delta from `9805d91` to `346df29`. No reconnaissance agent was spent in run-6: the parent inspected the full diff `346df29..530b29e`. **Line numbers in section 0.1 are exact at `530b29e`; section 0.2 has `346df29` numbers; sections 1-8 are `9805d91` numbers.**

## 0.1 Run-6 delta (changes in PRs #24 and #25, exact line numbers at `530b29e`)

- **Pre-read credential gate and anonymous body cap (`api.py`, `config.py`, `cli.py`, `deploy/`, PR #25 — run-5 N1 fix).**
  - `api.py:52-54`: `_UPLOAD_PATH = re.compile(r"/sandboxes/[^/]+/files")`, `_ANON_BODY_PATHS = {"/login"}`, `_ANON_BODY_MAX = 64 * 1024`.
  - `api.py:57-128` `_BodyLimit`: takes `authenticated` callback (`api.py:63-65`, wired at `api.py:185-201`). Rejects invalid/over-20-digit/over-cap `Content-Length` with 413 (`api.py:84-86`). Computes `has_body = (length is not None and int(length) > 0) or b"transfer-encoding" in headers` (`api.py:87`). If `has_body` and `scope["path"] in _ANON_BODY_PATHS`, lowers `cap = min(cap, _ANON_BODY_MAX)` (64 KiB) and rechecks `Content-Length` (`api.py:88-91`). Otherwise, if `has_body and self.authenticated and not await run_in_threadpool(self.authenticated, headers)`, rejects with 401 before reading any body (`api.py:92-95`). Streamed bodies remain capped at `cap` in `limited_receive` (`api.py:98-115`).
  - `api.py:185-199` `authenticated(headers)`: checks `Authorization: Bearer <token>` via `secrets.compare_digest` against `human_token` or `box.sandboxes.sandbox_for_token(token) is not None`, else parses `Cookie` with `http.cookies.SimpleCookie` and checks `box.desktop.session_scope(got.value)` for `D.COOKIE`. Route-level authorization (`human_only`, sandbox ownership, `same_origin`) still runs in route dependencies.
  - `config.py:68`: `max_connections` (`AGENTBOX_MAX_CONNECTIONS`, default 256; 0 disables); `cli.py:126-127` passes `limit_concurrency=s.max_connections` to `uvicorn.run`.
  - `deploy/Caddyfile:8-15`: `@upload path_regexp ^/sandboxes/[^/]+/files$` gets `AGENTBOX_PROXY_MAX_BODY` (256MB), `@other` gets `AGENTBOX_PROXY_MAX_JSON` (8MiB). `deploy/docker-compose.yml:20`: `mem_limit: ${AGENTBOX_MEM_LIMIT:-2g}`.
- **Desktop lock split and WebSocket threadpool offload (`desktop.py`, `desktop_ws.py`, `api.py`, PR #24 — run-5 F4 fix).**
  - `desktop.py:93-94`: `DesktopControl` splits `self._lock` (in-memory `_leases`, `_conns`, `_gui_locks`) from `self._db_lock` (SQLite `self._db`). Documented lock order when acquiring both: `_db_lock -> _lock`.
  - Ticket and session methods (`issue_ticket:116`, `redeem:124`, `start_session:139`, `end_session:147`, `session_scope:153`) take only `_db_lock`.
  - Lease and connection methods that touch both (`take:194`, `release:215`, `leftover_leases:235`, `forget_lease:246`, `close_all:299`) take `_db_lock` then `_lock`. In-memory-only methods (`lease`, `touch`, `is_stale`, `gui_lock`, `may_connect`, `add_conn`, `drop_conn`, `conns`, `end_session_conns`) take only `_lock`.
  - `api.py:441`: `desktop_ws` runs `await run_in_threadpool(box.desktop.session, cookie, sid)` before `same_origin(ws.headers)` (`api.py:442`, `same_origin` at `api.py:221-223`).
  - `desktop_ws.py:21-22`: `relay` runs `vnc_command` and `log_human("desktop_connect")` via `run_in_threadpool`. Periodic session recheck (`desktop_ws.py:76`) also uses `run_in_threadpool`. `finally` block (`desktop_ws.py:93-113`) runs `log_best_effort("desktop_disconnect")` on default executor inside `await asyncio.shield(logged)` before `box.desktop.drop_conn(conn)`.
- **GUI burst under takeover lease (`service.py`, PR #24 — run-5 F2 fix).**
  - `service.py:265-284` `_snapshot`: for `tool in GUI_INPUT`, after `sandboxes.snapshot`, acquires `with self._gui_locked(sid, "GUI 구간 열기"):`, runs `self._check_control(sid)`; only if no `HumanControl` is raised does it call `bursts.mark_snapshot(sid)` and `bursts.open(sid, snap["id"])`. Always appends the `snapshot` audit record (`service.py:280-281`), then if `human` was caught calls `self.bursts.reset_timers(sid)` and raises `human` (`service.py:282-284`).
  - `service.py:396-397`: `call_tool` catches `HumanControl` from `_snapshot` and delegates to `_human_blocked` (`service.py:411-419`, returns 423 and logs `tool_blocked`).
  - `service.py:498-514` `decide`: before `_snapshot`, if `tool in GUI_INPUT` and active lease or `_takeover_pending(sid)`, finishes approval as `FAILED` without taking a snapshot or opening a burst; also catches `HumanControl` from `_snapshot` (`service.py:511-514`).
- **Tool argument length cap, policy re-lex skip, and preview caps (`service.py`, `policy.py`, `preview.py`, `sandbox.py`, PR #24 — run-5 F1/F5/F6 fixes).**
  - `service.py:49`: `TOOL_ARG_MAX = 16 * 1024`. In `_call_tool` (`service.py:323-329`), before `tool_request` audit and `policy.decide`, rejects any arg `k != "content"` whose `len(v if isinstance(v, str) else json.dumps(v, default=str)) > TOOL_ARG_MAX` with 413 (`argument_too_long`).
  - `service.py:357-362`: in the `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` branch, applies `preview = bound_payload(preview)` before storing the pending approval row, and re-checks `if actor == "agent" and self.disk_low():` raising 507 before `_capture` and `approvals.create`.
  - `policy.py:27, 40-49, 73`: `_LEX_PUNCT = set(";&|()<>")`; `_relex_changes(t)` returns `False` for tokens consisting solely of `_LEX_PUNCT` or tokens with no whitespace, `_LEX_PUNCT`, quotes, or backslashes (e.g. `'x$'`), avoiding redundant recursive `_words(t, depth + 1)` calls.
  - `preview.py:70-71`: `PREVIEW_CALLS_MAX = 40`, `NOTES_MAX = 50`. `preview_command` (`preview.py:74-160`) deduplicates `rm` operands via `dict.fromkeys(operands)` (`:105`), caps total `expand`/`walk` calls at 40 via `budget()`, appends a Korean note when `skipped > 0` (`:154-156`), and truncates `notes` to `NOTES_MAX` plus a summary note (`:157-159`).
  - `sandbox.py:39, 104-106, 578-594`: `_PREVIEW_TIMEOUT = 10`; `_expand` and `_walk` wrap their container `sh -c` in `_timed(_PREVIEW_TIMEOUT, ...)` and call `_preview_ok(res)` (raises `SandboxError` on exit code 124 or 137).
- **Retention prune post-COMMIT archive safety (`retention.py`, PR #24 — run-5 F3 fix).**
  - `retention.py:104-108`: unlinks partial archive if `_write_archive` raises before the transaction.
  - `retention.py:131-145`: on exception inside the transaction block, rolls back only `if conn.in_transaction`; in the outer handler, queries `SELECT 1 FROM audit_anchor WHERE archive = ? AND archive_sha256 = ?` (defaulting `committed = True` on `sqlite3.Error`) and only unlinks the archive if `not committed`.

## 0.2 Run-5 delta (changes in PRs #16-#23, `346df29` line numbers)

- **Body cap (F1 fix, PR #16)**, **Audit cap (F3 fix, PR #16)**, **GUI gate (F2) and quota recheck (F7, PR #17)**, **Lifecycle lock (F6), F4 NUL-separated preview `_expand`/`_walk`, F5 single-flight `extract_novnc`, F8 login failure rate limit (PR #18)**, **Control-character filter `display.escape_controls` Cc/Cf/Zl/Zp (N5, PR #19)**, **Disk guard `disk_low` and finished-approval compaction (N2 stage 1, PR #20)**, **Host CLI `agentbox prune` and `audit_anchor` (N2 stage 2, PR #21)**, **Window owner via XRes `XResQueryClientIds` (N4, PR #22)**.
- **LLM-provider data path (PR #23)**: documented owner-accepted limitation; out of scope for hunting.

## 1. Product, principals, protected resources

agentbox is a self-hosted FastAPI + SQLite control plane. It gives AI agents Docker sandboxes, routes risky tool calls through a human approval queue, and keeps a hash-chained audit log. Desktop templates add Xvfb/Xfce/x11vnc/noVNC so a human can watch or take over the screen.

- **Human token** `hum_…` (one shared admin secret, `config.py`): full JSON API (`api.py` `principal`).
- **Browser cookie session**, scope `*` (login form or one-time `*` ticket): full UI. Sessions and tickets carry a `gen` fingerprint of the human token, so rotation revokes them (`desktop.py`).
- **Desktop-link session**, scope = one sandbox id: only that sandbox's desktop page/state/takeover/handback/WS (`api.py` `desktop_human`).
- **Agent token** `agt_…` per sandbox (hash stored): tools on its own sandbox, read own sandbox/approval/desktop state. Lowest-trust network principal; the threat model assumes a prompt-injected agent.
- **Code inside the sandbox**: uid 1000 `agent` (exec, file tools) and uid 1001 `desktop` (X session, GUI tools, x11vnc; in the agent group). Every container output (exec stdout, `ps`, `xdotool`, `find -printf` manifest, outbox listing, `ls`, preview `_expand`/`_walk`, screenshot bytes, RFB stream) is attacker data to the control plane.
- **Unauthenticated network clients**: `/`, `/login` (GET/POST; failed POST writes an audit row), `/static/htmx.min.js`, `/static/novnc/*` (`api.py`, may create a container via `extract_novnc`), `/healthz`, ticket redemption, FastAPI `/docs`.
- **MCP stdio server / `agent.py` loop**: hold an agent token; trust the local launcher.

Protected resources: the human token and approval authority; host filesystem and Docker daemon (the control plane holds `docker.sock` = host root); other sandboxes; `/workspace` restore points (snapshots before destructive actions and per GUI burst); audit-log integrity and secret masking; control-plane availability (thread pools, memory, SQLite, host disk via `docker commit`).

## 2. Comparable baseline

No source-grounded comparable product. Components: MCP (FastMCP/MCPServer stdio), RFB via x11vnc `-inetd` + socat + noVNC, gVisor/Kata named as preferred runtimes. A runc sandbox shares the host kernel.

## 3. Stack, deployment, offline limits

Python ≥3.11; fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, jinja2, docker SDK, pyyaml, mcp. Modes: `agentbox serve` (127.0.0.1 default; `bind_problem` and `runtime_problem` gates; `runtime_problem` rejects only the literal `"runc"`), compose + Caddy with `--behind-tls-proxy` and `forwarded_allow_ips="*"` by default, and the bare `create_app` factory (`api.py`) that skips the serve-time gates. Container flags (`sandbox.py`): `network_mode=none`, non-recursive read-only `/source` bind, `cap_drop ALL` + CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER/SETUID/SETGID, no-new-privileges, mem/cpu/pids limits, no userns, default seccomp. The desktop start script resets `/home/desktop` on every start and restore (v19 fix).

Host for this run: Windows 11 with Docker Desktop WSL2 Linux engine 29.9.2, runtimes `runc`/`io.containerd.runc.v2`, images `ubuntu:24.04`, `buildpack-deps:noble-curl`, `agentbox-desktop:0.1`, `agentbox-audit-sbx:1`. Agent-run code goes through `tools/sbx.py` (no network, read-only target at `/target`, writable `/scratch`, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 64 pids, 120 s). Docker-free tests: `tests/test_unit.py`, `test_m2_unit.py`, `test_m4_unit.py`, `test_m5_unit.py`, `test_retention.py`. Anything needing the real daemon is a parent-live check.

## 4. Entry surfaces and important paths

- **Tools**: `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/tools/{tool}` → `AgentBox.call_tool` (per-sandbox concurrency 4, `_snap_locks`) → `_call_tool` (16 KiB arg cap `TOOL_ARG_MAX` → audit with capped args `_logged_args` → `policy.decide` → quota → approval with bounded preview & `disk_low` recheck or `_snapshot` → `_run_tool`) on the 32-thread `tool_pool`. Pending approvals capped at 20.
- **Approvals**: `POST /approvals/{aid}` / `POST /ui/approvals/...` (human) → `decide`: atomic claim, GUI lease check, snapshot, run stored args. Preview (`preview.py` `preview_command` with `_expand`/`_walk` callbacks, 40-call budget, 10 s timeout per call) and capture run before the approval exists.
- **Lifecycle**: `pause_sandbox/resume_sandbox/snapshot_sandbox/restore_sandbox/delete_sandbox` se

**Quota-accounting scope and reset gaps**
Accounting uses attacker-influenceable IP, route, tenant, key prefix, task ID, or other dimension, allowing one principal's work to escape its intended budget or consume another principal's allocation. Review integer overflow, distributed races, retries, reconnects, and account switching.

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Unsafe recovery and capacity rollback -->
**Unsafe recovery and capacity rollback**
A restart, restore, fallback, or cleanup path rebuilds unbounded state, ignores current quotas, or restores the input that immediately repeats failure. Recovery correctness is part of availability.

# Execution boundary and paths

- Agent ID `r-disk-low`. Write ONLY in `<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-6/agents/r-disk-low/scratch/`. Never edit target files, the ledger, findings, architecture or another agent's directory.
- Run target-controlled code only through `python "<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-6/tools/sbx.py" r-disk-low <cmd...>`: audited source read-only at /target (on PYTHONPATH), scratch at /scratch, no network, no Docker socket, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 1 CPU, 64 pids, 32 MiB files, 120 s. Use `/usr/bin/python3`.
- Unit tests need cwd=/target: `python "<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-6/tools/sbx.py" r-disk-low /usr/bin/sh -c "cd /target && /usr/bin/python3 -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider --capture=sys -q tests/test_m5_unit.py"`.
- If you produce a local artifact, list it in a top-level `"artifacts_to_promote": [...]` field (scratch-relative, <=256 KiB each). The parent promotes it after you finish.
- Your final message must be ONLY one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"agentbox/service.py:disk_low-unmonitored-docker-data-root"}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`. No prose, no code fence.
