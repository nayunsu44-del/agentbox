You are independent re-verifier `p5r-v10` in a defensive security audit of agentbox.
A Phase 5 verifier proposed the replacement record below; it changes the verdict, root cause, evidence or demonstrated result of an earlier final record, so it may be applied only after an independent check. You did not hunt it, validate it in Phase 3, or propose it. Recheck the current audited source and independently reproduce any decisive local result under the execution boundary (where the decisive result is the parent's live run, re-read the script and output and judge whether they establish it), then return `verified` or another replacement.

# Source under audit

- Read source ONLY from the audited tree `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-agentbox/1357e46b-55dd-58a4-b1d6-d791486808ee/scratchpad/src-audited/` (git worktree at commit 8e4db9e; agentbox/, images/, deploy/, tests/ are byte-identical to the run's source_ref 0e4b958). Record paths and line numbers refer to this tree.
- `/home/user/agentbox` is the working branch and already carries later fixes; do not use it to check lines.

# Execution boundary (verbatim from the skill)

```text
You did not write this candidate. Try to refute it from repository source and bounded
local evidence. Do not contact deployed endpoints or external/shared services. Run
target-controlled code only inside the approved OS-enforced sandbox: no external
network, empty allowlisted environment, read-only target and tools, scratch-only
writes, and explicit low resource and wall-clock limits. If any control is unavailable,
do not execute; retain the exact missing capability as a needs_validation blocker.
Treat every scratch entry as target-controlled after execution. After the sandbox and
all its processes terminate, only trusted parent-side code may promote a predeclared
scratch-relative file, following the promotion procedure block included verbatim in
this prompt. You and target code never write retained artifacts. If promotion is
unavailable or fails, do not use that file as evidence.
```

# Phase 5 checks for a `needs_validation` record (verbatim from the skill)

```text
1. The source path is real and supports only the `claimed_root_cause` stated.
2. Every listed blocker is decisive and not already answerable locally.
3. The candidate names a boundary and a possible concrete result rather than a generic concern.
4. At least one validation-plan field is present and exact. `local` uses a bounded fixture; `deployment` asks an owner to observe a configuration, identity, route, policy, or runtime fact. Do not invent a plan for an inapplicable context, and never send audit traffic to a deployment.
5. The fingerprint matches prior/current records for the same root cause.
```

A replacement may correct wording or lines, demote, reject, or promote. If evidence below (yours or the parent's) establishes the complete path and a bounded observed result, a promotion to `confirmed` is a full replacement record in the `confirmed` branch; it will be checked again by another fresh verifier before it is applied. If a check fails only on a non-material wording or line issue, say so in `reason` and return the corrected record. Do not invent a stronger result than the evidence shows.

 "description": "Agent GUI tools (screenshot/click/type/key) run through AgentBox._run_tool, which acquires desktop.gui_lock(sid) and calls SandboxManager._x -> docker exec_run (scrot/xdotool) with no container-side timeout wrapper, unlike exec (timeout -k 5), read_file and outbox_read (timeout -k 2 30). takeover and handback acquire the same plain threading.Lock via `with`, with no acquisition deadline. If the X server stops answering while an agent GUI exec is outstanding, that exec blocks inside the held lock, so the human takeover (the safety override for a misbehaving screen) and handback queue behind it. Source chain verified at the cited lines; gui_lock is a plain threading.Lock (desktop.py:155-158). Parent-live evidence (the parent's, not the verifier's; no Docker here): l1_takeover.py SIGSTOPs Xvfb (uid desktop=1001) in a real desktop sandbox, issues an agent screenshot that hangs holding gui_lock, then starts a takeover: it does not return within 20 s. l10_bound.py (after Phase 3) ran the same setup for 150 s: after 151 s both the screenshot and the takeover were still blocked, and both returned only after SIGCONT (screenshot 153 s, takeover 151 s). So the hang is not capped by the docker SDK client timeout and the lock is not released by a ReadTimeout, which settles the bound: the lockout lasts as long as X stays unresponsive. Not yet established: that a prompt-injected agent, using only its own agent-token capabilities, can itself make X unresponsive. The parent's SIGSTOP was a docker exec as uid 1001, standing in for a GUI terminal step (N-1). Source makes it plausible: the type/key tools can drive xfce4-terminal (Dockerfile:19), which runs as the same uid as Xvfb, and a process may signal another process of its own uid.",

# Parent-live evidence (run by the parent, not by a hunter or verifier)

The parent ran these bounded checks against the real Docker-backed control plane and desktop image (disposable containers, loopback only, dummy tokens) or a real Chromium on loopback. You cannot run Docker or a browser; treat them as owner-observed local evidence: re-read every script, confirm it exercises the claimed path against the audited source, and judge whether its output establishes the claim. Say in the record if the decisive reproduction is the parent's rather than yours.
Checks marked (after Phase 3) were run after this record was written and are not yet reflected in it.

# Architecture facts

# agentbox architecture summary (run-3)

Source ref: `0e4b958` on `ccr-e10bee8e-6wt669` (PR #5 head; `agentbox/` identical after merge to `main`). Profile `standard`, whole repo.

## 1. Product, principals, protected resources

agentbox is a self-hosted control plane (FastAPI + SQLite) that gives AI agents Docker sandboxes, routes risky tool calls through a human approval queue, and keeps a hash-chained audit log. A desktop mode adds Xvfb/Xfce/noVNC so a human can watch or take over the screen.

- **Human token** `hum_…` (one shared admin secret, `config.py:88-100`): full API.
- **Web UI cookie session**, scope `*` (token login form or one-time `*` ticket): full UI (`web.py:208-242`, `desktop.py`).
- **Desktop-link session**, scope = one sandbox id (redeemed per-sandbox ticket): only that sandbox's desktop page/state/takeover/handback/WS (`api.py:134-140,298-336`, `desktop.py:147-152`).
- **Agent token** `agt_…` per sandbox (hash stored): tool calls on its own sandbox, read own sandbox/approval/desktop state (`api.py:160-230,315`). Lowest-trust network principal; the threat model assumes a prompt-injected agent.
- **Code inside the sandbox**: uid 1000 `agent` (tool execs), uid 1001 `desktop` (X session, GUI tools, x11vnc; member of the agent group, `/workspace` group-writable). Container output (exec stdout, `ps`, `xdotool`, `find -printf` manifest, outbox listings, file names) is attacker-controlled input to the control plane.
- **MCP stdio server / agent.py LLM loop**: hold an agent token; inherit trust from the local launcher.

Protected resources: the human token and approval authority; host filesystem and Docker daemon (control plane holds `docker.sock` = host root); other sandboxes; integrity of `/workspace` restore points (AP-2 snapshots before destructive actions); audit-log integrity and secret masking; control-plane availability (shared thread pool, memory, host disk via `docker commit`).

## 2. Comparable baseline

No source-grounded comparable product. Components: MCP (FastMCP stdio), VNC/RFB via x11vnc+noVNC, gVisor/Kata runtimes. A runc sandbox shares the host kernel; the code refuses runc only when the control plane is exposed (`cli.py:79-115`).

## 3. Stack, deployment, offline limits

Python ≥3.11; fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, jinja2, docker SDK, pyyaml, mcp. Modes: local `agentbox serve` (127.0.0.1), direct TLS, `--behind-tls-proxy` (compose + Caddy, `forwarded_allow_ips="*"` by default), `--insecure`, and the bare `uvicorn agentbox.api:create_app --factory` path that skips serve-time checks. Container flags: `network_mode=none`, `/source` read-only bind, `cap_drop ALL` + CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER/SETUID/SETGID, no-new-privileges, mem/cpu/pids limits; no userns, default seccomp (`sandbox.py:367-388`). Host: Docker 29.9.1, runtimes `runc` and `io.containerd.runc.v2` only (no gVisor/Kata), cgroup v1, images `agentbox-desktop:0.1`, `buildpack-deps:noble-curl`. Pure-function harnesses and the three unit test modules fit the parent's `sbx` sandbox; anything that builds the app needs the Docker daemon (parent-live checks).

## 4. Entry surfaces and important paths

- JSON API `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/tools/{tool}` → `service.call_tool` (per-sandbox concurrency 4, 429) → audit → `policy.decide` → allow / approval queue → `sandbox.exec|read_file|write_file|delete_file|list_dir|gui_*` (`docker exec` as uid 1000/1001), dedicated 32-thread `tool_pool` (`api.py:81`). Exec output streamed and capped (`_Head`, 64 KB).
- Approvals `POST /approvals/{aid}` (human only) → atomic claim → pre-snapshot → run with the agent's original args; terminal approver `cli.py` renders args through `_safe()`.
- Snapshots: `docker commit` before write/delete overwrite and per GUI burst; quota 50 → approval (`service.py:199-204`); per-sandbox `_snap_locks`.
- GUI bursts (`service.py:186-260`): snapshot + manifest + baseline pids at burst start; at close, kill new uid-1001 processes classified by `gui_strays` from root `ps` output and `xdotool` window pids (`sandbox.py:174-225,686-697`), diff `find -printf` manifest (8 MB cap) and log `gui_changes`. Closed on idle from `expire_stale`, `call_tool`, `GET /audit`, UI audit fragment, takeover, end_desktop.
- Files: `read_file` (`timeout` + `[ -f ]` FIFO guard), `outbox_list/read`, `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/files` upload, `source_dir` copy at create (refuses overlap with `settings.home`/DB dir).
- Desktop: tickets (60 s, one-time, hashed), sessions (12 h, hashed, `scope`), leases keyed by public session id `hs_`+32 bits, WS `/desktop/ws` (cookie + same_origin; control needs lease; re-check every 30 s, `session_ended` handback), logout `end_ui_session`.
- Audit: hash chain with append-only triggers, `mask_text` regex set (`audit.py`), UI/CLI timelines render container-controlled strings (`web.py describe`, Jinja autoescape; `cli._safe`).
- Serve: `bind_problem`, `runtime_problem` (literal `"runc"` only), `--allow-runc`/`AGENTBOX_ALLOW_RUNC`.

## 5. Trust boundaries and strongest control

| Boundary | Strongest control |
|---|---|
| Agent → host/other sandboxes | container hardening + runtime (runc here) |
| Agent → approval gate (exec) | `policy.simple_programs` allowlist + `has_bash_comment` + `>` gate |
| Agent → approval gate (GUI) | none by design; burst snapshot, `gui_changes`, stray kill (partial, N-1) |
| Agent → human authority | token kinds, `human_only`, scope checks, source_dir overlap check |
| Agent → control-plane availability | tool_pool, tool_concurrency, `_Head`, snapshot quota, read timeouts |
| Container output → control plane | parsers `_parse_ps`, `_parse_manifest`, `_parse_outbox`; masking; escaping |
| Browser → UI | SameSite=Strict HttpOnly cookie, `same_origin` (missing Origin allowed) |
| Desktop-link session → rest of UI | `scope` column, `desktop_human` |
| Network → control plane | `bind_problem` TLS gate; proxy trust `*` |

## 6. Starting paths

`agentbox/service.py`, `sandbox.py`, `api.py`, `policy.py`, `desktop.py`, `audit.py`, `web.py`, `cli.py`, `config.py`, `approvals.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `agent.py`, `default_policy.yaml`, `images/desktop/`, `deploy/`.

## 7. Prior coverage and revalidation

run-1 (`7fc501f`, standard, source-only) ledger: 15 units; run-2 validated live. 9 confirmed records, all with changed source (fixed in PR #1–#5; N-1 GUI bypass only partially mitigated) → `prior_confirmed_changed_source` revalidation units, not excluded from hunting. One rejected claim (`desktop.py:redeem:sandbox-scoped-ticket-mints-unscoped-full-admin-session`): source changed (scope column), so the unit is current work. No same-source confirmed exclusions. Changed since `7fc501f`: 9 source files (+598/−67) — first priority.

## 8. Companion selection

- `RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md`: agent-driven work consumes the shared pool, memory, host disk.
- `AI-AND-LLM.md`: tool-calling agent behind an approval gate; MCP server; prompt-injection threat model.
- `WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md`: cookie sessions, tickets, login, proxy headers.
- `CLIENT-SIDE.md`: browser UI with htmx and a cookie-authenticated WebSocket.
- `DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md`: x11vnc/docker-exec bridge, uid 1001 desktop helper killed/inspected by the control plane.
- `CLOUD-AND-DEPLOYMENT.md`: container capabilities, runtime selection, compose/proxy precedence.
- `DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md`: snapshots/restore, delete, audit as alternate reader.
- Excluded: `MEMORY-SAFETY-AND-BINARY.md` (no native code in scope), `SUPPLY-CHAIN-AND-RELEASE.md` (no release/signing path; CI only runs tests), `PROTOCOLS-RPC-AND-MESSAGING.md` (no broker/RPC beyond HTTP/WS/MCP stdio covered elsewhere).


# Execution paths

- Agent ID `p5r-v10`. Write ONLY in `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-3/agents/p5r-v10/scratch/`. Never edit target files, the ledger, findings, other agents' directories, or anything under /home/user/agentbox outside that scratch directory. Do not run git commands that change state.
- Run target code only via `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-agentbox/1357e46b-55dd-58a4-b1d6-d791486808ee/scratchpad/sbx5 p5r-v10 <cmd...>` (audited source at /target read-only on PYTHONPATH, scratch at /scratch, no network, no Docker socket, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 1 CPU, 64 pids, 120 s). Use `/usr/bin/python3.13`. Never run target code outside sbx5.
- If you produce a local artifact, list it in a top-level `"artifacts_to_promote": [...]` field (scratch-relative; <=256 KiB each) and reference it as `agents/p5r-v10/artifacts/<file>`.

```text
Artifact promotion procedure (trusted parent-side code only):
Reference only for you: the parent performs these steps; you never perform them.

Before execution, the parent opens and retains trusted, non-inheritable directory
descriptors for the agent's scratch/ and artifacts/ roots, and records an allowlist
of expected scratch-relative artifact files plus explicit per-file and cumulative
byte limits. Never pass those descriptors to the agent or sandbox. After the sandbox
and all its processes terminate, trusted parent-side code promotes each allowlisted
file separately:

1. Validate the declared relative path: reject absolute, empty, `.`, `..`, or
   symlinked components.
2. Walk each parent component from the retained scratch-root descriptor with
   no-follow directory-relative operations; never reopen by path.
3. Open the leaf no-follow and nonblocking.
4. Verify with `fstat` that it is a regular file with link count exactly one and
   within the recorded per-file and cumulative byte limits.
5. Enforce those limits again while reading from that descriptor.
6. Copy exactly the verified size, repeat `fstat`, and reject a changed identity,
   type, link count, or size.
7. For the destination, walk every parent component from the retained
   artifacts-root descriptor with no-follow directory-relative operations; require
   each existing component to be a real directory, and create any missing directory
   exclusively before reopening and verifying it no-follow.
8. Create the leaf exclusively without following links, verify that the opened
   destination is a regular file with link count exactly one, and copy from the
   verified source descriptor without reopening either path.
9. Use equivalent race-safe APIs on non-POSIX systems.
10. Never recursively copy or glob scratch, extract an archive into artifacts, or
    open or promote a symlink, FIFO, socket, device, directory, hard-linked file,
    changing file, or file that exceeds its bound.
11. If any check is unavailable, cannot be enforced, or fails, discard the scratch
    entry; if it is decisive evidence, retain `needs_validation` with the exact
    promotion blocker.

# Output

Return exactly one JSON object with no prose and no markdown fence, one of:
{"decision": "verified", "fingerprint": "<the record's fingerprint>"}
{"decision": "replace", "reason": "<what failed and why>", "record": {...}, "artifacts_to_promote": [...]}
A replacement record must match its `confirmed`, `needs_validation`, or `rejected` branch exactly (additionalProperties: false) and keep the same fingerprint unless you identified a genuinely different root cause. `artifacts_to_promote` is optional. Overall severity cannot exceed demonstrated impact; only confirmed records carry severity.
