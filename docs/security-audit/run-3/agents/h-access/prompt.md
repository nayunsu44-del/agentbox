You are hunter `h-access` in a defensive security audit of agentbox. Your goal is to find source-grounded security invariant failures in your assigned coverage units, and you must return exactly one JSON object matching the structured-result contract at the end of this prompt.

# architecture.md (verbatim)

# agentbox architecture summary (run-3)

Source ref: `0e4b958` on `ccr-e10bee8e-6wt669` (PR #5 head; `agentbox/` identical after merge to `main`). Profile `standard`, whole repo.

## 1. Product, principals, protected resources

agentbox is a self-hosted control plane (FastAPI + SQLite) that gives AI agents Docker sandboxes, routes risky tool calls through a human approval queue, and keeps a hash-chained audit log. A desktop mode adds Xvfb/Xfce/noVNC so a human can watch or take over the screen.

- **Human token** `hum_…` (one shared admin secret, `config.py:88-100`): full API.
- **Web UI cookie session**, scope `*` (token login form or one-time `*` ticket): full UI (`web.py:208-242`, `desktop.py`).
- **Desktop-link session**, scope = one sandbox id (redeemed per-sandbox ticket): only that sandbox's desktop page/state/takeover/handback/WS (`api.py:134-140,298-336`, `desktop.py:147-152`).
- **Agent token** `agt_…` per sandbox (hash stored): tool calls on its own sandbox, read own sandbox/approval/desktop state (`api.py:160-230,315`). Lowest-trust network principal; the threat model assumes a prompt-injected agent.
- **Code inside the sandbox**: uid 1000 `agent` (tool execs), uid 1001 `desktop` (X session, GUI tools, x11vnc; member of the agent group, `/workspace` group-writable). Container output (exec stdout, `ps`, `xdotool`, `find -printf` manifest, outbox listings, file names) is attacker-controlled input to the control plane.
- **MCP stdio server / agent.py LLM loop**: hold an agent token; inherit trust from the local launcher.

Protected resources: the human token and approval authority; host filesystem and Docker daemon (control plane holds `docker.sock` = host root); other sandboxes; integrity of `/workspace` restore points (AP-2 snapshots before destructive actions); audit-log integrity and secret masking; control-plane availability (shared thread pool, memory, host disk via `docker commit`).

## 2. Comparable baseline

No source-grounded comparable product. Components: MCP (FastMCP stdio), VNC/RFB via x11vnc+noVNC, gVisor/Kata runtimes. A runc sandbox shares the host kernel; the code refuses runc only when the control plane is exposed (`cli.py:79-115`).

## 3. Stack, deployment, offline limits

Python ≥3.11; fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, jinja2, docker SDK, pyyaml, mcp. Modes: local `agentbox serve` (127.0.0.1), direct TLS, `--behind-tls-proxy` (compose + Caddy, `forwarded_allow_ips="*"` by default), `--insecure`, and the bare `uvicorn agentbox.api:create_app --factory` path that skips serve-time checks. Container flags: `network_mode=none`, `/source` read-only bind, `cap_drop ALL` + CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER/SETUID/SETGID, no-new-privileges, mem/cpu/pids limits; no userns, default seccomp (`sandbox.py:367-388`). Host: Docker 29.9.1, runtimes `runc` and `io.containerd.runc.v2` only (no gVisor/Kata), cgroup v1, images `agentbox-desktop:0.1`, `buildpack-deps:noble-curl`. Pure-function harnesses and the three unit test modules fit the parent's `sbx` sandbox; anything that builds the app needs the Docker daemon (parent-live checks).

## 4. Entry surfaces and important paths

- JSON API `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/tools/{tool}` → `service.call_tool` (per-sandbox concurrency 4, 429) → audit → `policy.decide` → allow / approval queue → `sandbox.exec|read_file|write_file|delete_file|list_dir|gui_*` (`docker exec` as uid 1000/1001), dedicated 32-thread `tool_pool` (`api.py:81`). Exec output streamed and capped (`_Head`, 64 KB).
- Approvals `POST /approvals/{aid}` (human only) → atomic claim → pre-snapshot → run with the agent's original args; terminal approver `cli.py` renders args through `_safe()`.
- Snapshots: `docker commit` before write/delete overwrite and per GUI burst; quota 50 → approval (`service.py:199-204`); per-sandbox `_snap_locks`.
- GUI bursts (`service.py:186-260`): snapshot + manifest + baseline pids at burst start; at close, kill new uid-1001 processes classified by `gui_strays` from root `ps` output and `xdotool` window pids (`sandbox.py:174-225,686-697`), diff `find -printf` manifest (8 MB cap) and log `gui_changes`. Closed on idle from `expire_stale`, `call_tool`, `GET /audit`, UI audit fragment, takeover, end_desktop.
- Files: `read_file` (`timeout` + `[ -f ]` FIFO guard), `outbox_list/read`, `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/files` upload, `source_dir` copy at create (refuses overlap with `settings.home`/DB dir).
- Desktop: tickets (60 s, one-time, hashed), sessions (12 h, hashed, `scope`), leases keyed by public session id `hs_`+32 bits, WS `/desktop/ws` (cookie + same_origin; control needs lease; re-check every 30 s, `session_ended` handback), logout `end_ui_session`.
- Audit: hash chain with append-only triggers, `mask_text` regex set (`audit.py`), UI/CLI timelines render container-controlled strings (`web.py describe`, Jinja autoescape; `cli._safe`).
- Serve: `bind_problem`, `runtime_problem` (literal `"runc"` only), `--allow-runc`/`AGENTBOX_ALLOW_RUNC`.

## 5. Trust boundaries and strongest control

| Boundary | Strongest control |
|---|---|
| Agent → host/other sandboxes | container hardening + runtime (runc here) |
| Agent → approval gate (exec) | `policy.simple_programs` allowlist + `has_bash_comment` + `>` gate |
| Agent → approval gate (GUI) | none by design; burst snapshot, `gui_changes`, stray kill (partial, N-1) |
| Agent → human authority | token kinds, `human_only`, scope checks, source_dir overlap check |
| Agent → control-plane availability | tool_pool, tool_concurrency, `_Head`, snapshot quota, read timeouts |
| Container output → control plane | parsers `_parse_ps`, `_parse_manifest`, `_parse_outbox`; masking; escaping |
| Browser → UI | SameSite=Strict HttpOnly cookie, `same_origin` (missing Origin allowed) |
| Desktop-link session → rest of UI | `scope` column, `desktop_human` |
| Network → control plane | `bind_problem` TLS gate; proxy trust `*` |

## 6. Starting paths

`agentbox/service.py`, `sandbox.py`, `api.py`, `policy.py`, `desktop.py`, `audit.py`, `web.py`, `cli.py`, `config.py`, `approvals.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `agent.py`, `default_policy.yaml`, `images/desktop/`, `deploy/`.

## 7. Prior coverage and revalidation

run-1 (`7fc501f`, standard, source-only) ledger: 15 units; run-2 validated live. 9 confirmed records, all with changed source (fixed in PR #1–#5; N-1 GUI bypass only partially mitigated) → `prior_confirmed_changed_source` revalidation units, not excluded from hunting. One rejected claim (`desktop.py:redeem:sandbox-scoped-ticket-mints-unscoped-full-admin-session`): source changed (scope column), so the unit is current work. No same-source confirmed exclusions. Changed since `7fc501f`: 9 source files (+598/−67) — first priority.

## 8. Companion selection

- `RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md`: agent-driven work consumes the shared pool, memory, host disk.
- `AI-AND-LLM.md`: tool-calling agent behind an approval gate; MCP server; prompt-injection threat model.
- `WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md`: cookie sessions, tickets, login, proxy headers.
- `CLIENT-SIDE.md`: browser UI with htmx and a cookie-authenticated WebSocket.
- `DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md`: x11vnc/docker-exec bridge, uid 1001 desktop helper killed/inspected by the control plane.
- `CLOUD-AND-DEPLOYMENT.md`: container capabilities, runtime selection, compose/proxy precedence.
- `DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md`: snapshots/restore, delete, audit as alternate reader.
- Excluded: `MEMORY-SAFETY-AND-BINARY.md` (no native code in scope), `SUPPLY-CHAIN-AND-RELEASE.md` (no release/signing path; CI only runs tests), `PROTOCOLS-RPC-AND-MESSAGING.md` (no broker/RPC beyond HTTP/WS/MCP stdio covered elsewhere).

## Parent-provided reconnaissance leads (unverified; settle each one either way, do not assume)

- Agent token reads its own `GET /sandboxes/{sid}` including the host `source_dir` path. `log_human` writes audit before validating sid.
- Check every route for the right principal and the right resource: agent token on human routes, agent token of sandbox A on sandbox B, desktop-link session (scope = sid) on non-desktop routes (capture.png, files, outbox, approvals, /ui/*), header-vs-cookie precedence in `screen_principal`, `GET /approvals/{aid}` field filtering for agents, approval decision on an approval of a deleted/restored sandbox, handback with header token.
- Obvious-things unit: be literal and thorough per the block; trace impact before reporting anything.

# Selected attack-class blocks (verbatim)


<!-- ATTACK-CLASSES.md#Access control -->
**Access control** (subagent_type: `general`)
Verify that a caller cannot do something outside its authority. Go beyond checking whether permission checks exist — verify they check the *right* permission for the *right* resource via the *right* mechanism:
- Is there a path to the same state change that checks a different (weaker) permission?
- Can a field in the request body override what the permission system intended to restrict?
- Are there endpoints that gate on authentication but forget authorization?
- Does the same resource have multiple access paths with inconsistent checks?
- What about bulk/batch/export/import operations — do they enforce per-item permissions?

For complex access models, split into separate agents for auth bypass vs authorization logic.

<!-- WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md#Core discipline -->
## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Framing and cache findings require two interpretations of the same request, response, or key. Name both components and the exact normalized value on each side.
- For every credential, find the signature or secret verification and every binding required for its role: issuer, audience, origin, RP, client, session, principal, resource, assurance, expiry, and one-time state.
- Host, Forwarded, X-Forwarded-*, Origin, Referer, redirect targets, callback state, and request-derived URLs are trust decisions. Trace each to the affected identity or response.
- A missing header, cookie attribute, MFA prompt, or rate limit is not a finding alone. Require an accepted invalid request, cross-principal impact, assurance downgrade, or credential disclosure.
- Classify `confirmed` only from complete source evidence and bounded local request/token tests. Use `needs_validation` when proxy, IdP, browser, certificate, secret, or deployed configuration is required but not visible.
```

<!-- WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md#API-key scope and resource binding -->
**API-key scope and resource binding**
A key authenticates to broader tenants, resources, actions, or environments than its server-side record grants, or request parameters override those bindings. Review key lookup, prefix/full-secret verification, type confusion between publishable and secret keys, scope checks, rotation, revocation caches, and bulk endpoints.

<!-- WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md#Universal moves -->
## Universal moves (apply across the above)

- Walk issue → store → transmit → consume → refresh → revoke for every credential and challenge. Compare normal, error, retry, migration, legacy, and account-switch paths.
- Enumerate every door to the same identity and every route to the same sensitive operation. The effective policy is the weakest parallel path, not the most polished UI.
- Diff parser, proxy, router, cache, and application normalization side by side. For local validation, feed identical bounded request fixtures into each component rather than sending traffic to a live deployment.
- For recovery and linking, draw the account before/after graph. Each edge must name the current principal, proof of the new identity, required assurance, callback/session binding, and revocation effect.

<!-- WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md#Validation rules -->
## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Apply a source-visibility gate. Proxy chains, edge cache keys, IdP policy, certificate trust, browser cookie behavior, secrets, and deployed auth modes may be outside the repository. Record a precise `needs_validation` candidate instead of asserting missing infrastructure behavior.
2. For framing and cache findings, name both components and the divergent parse/key. Confirm cross-request, cross-user, or private-response impact with bounded local fixtures.
3. For token, MFA, passkey, account-link, recovery, API-key, and mTLS findings, cite the verification line and missing principal/session/resource/origin/audience/action/assurance binding. Prove the server accepts the invalid transition or credential.
4. For CSRF, name the ambient credential, state-changing route, accepted cross-site request shape, browser cookie policy, and missing effective check. Read-only actions and routes requiring a non-ambient bearer token do not qualify.
5. Verify framework and library defaults. If version or configuration is unknown, use `needs_validation`; do not turn an unverified critical claim into a lower-severity confirmed finding.
6. Return `confirmed` only with a complete source trace and observable unauthorized identity, state, or disclosure. For `needs_validation`, name the missing fact and safe local or owner-observed check that resolves it.

<!-- ATTACK-CLASSES.md#Obvious things -->
**Obvious things** (subagent_type: `general`)
Other agents hunt subtle bugs. This agent checks the basic exposures that are easy to overlook because everyone assumes someone else already checked them:
- Are there any hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens, or secrets in the source? (grep for `password`, `secret`, `apikey`, `token`, `Bearer`, `-----BEGIN`, common default passwords)
- Are there any TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX comments that reference security? (`TODO: add auth`, `FIXME: validate input`, `HACK: skip permission check`)
- Is debug mode / dev mode properly gated? Can it be enabled in production via environment variable, query parameter, or header?
- Are there test/example/seed credentials that work in production?
- Is there a `/debug`, `/admin`, `/test`, `/status`, `/health`, `/metrics`, `/env`, `/.env`, `/config` endpoint that is unprotected?
- Are there any `.env`, `.env.local`, `credentials.json`, `*.pem`, `*.key` files checked into the repo?
- Does the `.gitignore` actually cover secrets, uploads, and local config?
- Are dependencies pinned? Are there known CVEs in the dependency tree? (check lockfiles)
- Are there any `eval()`, `exec()`, `child_process`, `Function()`, `vm.runInContext`, `import()` with dynamic input?
- Are CORS headers set to `*` or overly permissive? Is `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` combined with a wildcard origin?
- Are cookies missing `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, or `SameSite` attributes?
- Are there any open redirects? (parameters named `redirect`, `return`, `next`, `url`, `goto`, `continue` that feed into redirects without validation)
- Is TLS enforced? Are there any HTTP-only endpoints?
- Are error responses in production returning stack traces, internal paths, or SQL errors?

This agent does not need to be creative. It needs to be thorough and literal. Check every item. Report each result.

# Core hunting method

```text
## Defensive vulnerability-finding method

Your goal is to find source-grounded security invariant failures and the smallest fix,
not to expand harm beyond the boundary result. Stay within source review and bounded local execution.
Do not contact deployed endpoints, provider APIs, registries, identity systems,
message brokers, shared services, or other users. Use local dummy data only.

READ THE CODE AT DEPTH. Follow each assigned input through parsing, identity,
authorization, normalization, state, derived copies, and the final sink. Read sibling,
legacy, batch, retry, cancellation, migration, and error paths that produce the same
effect. Compare sibling controls for equivalence, not only presence, and compare what
one component guarantees with what the next component assumes.

WORK FROM A CONCRETE INVARIANT:
1. Name the lower-trust principal and starting capability.
2. Name the accepted value, action, state transition, or resource selector.
3. Locate the control that should reject, bind, isolate, limit, or revoke it.
4. Trace the exact source path after that decision.
5. Stop at the smallest affected dummy record, wrong return value, process-integrity
   effect, or locally observable shared-resource effect.
6. State a source-level change and regression case that enforce the invariant.

DEPTH BOUND: trace only paths that can reach your assigned boundary or whose
guarantees that boundary relies on. Stop a line of investigation as soon as the
invariant is settled either way, and record the result in your structured output —
a covered, candidate, or blocked disposition, or an `uncovered` entry — instead of
continuing to search.

TEST SAD PATHS AND DISAGREEMENTS. Check absent, empty, zero, negative, maximum,
over-limit, duplicate, mixed encoding, stale, revoked, reordered, concurrent,
partially migrated, failed dependency, and rollback state only where the interface
accepts them. Compare canonicalization and units at every parser or policy handoff.
For multi-step issues, treat each output as a prerequisite and do not assume a later
boundary. If any prerequisite is not established, record a blocker.

When a proposed high or critical candidate reveals a reusable root cause, search paths
owned by the assigned coverage IDs for lexical, structural, and logical variants.
Consolidate the same root cause, but establish each variant's conditions and impact
independently. Do not investigate peer-owned units. Return a variant with no current
coverage unit as `uncovered`.

USE THE NARROWEST LOCAL CHECK THAT SETTLES THE CLAIM. Target-controlled builds,
tests, processes, browsers, emulators, fuzzers, and fixture processing may run only
inside the parent-approved OS-enforced sandbox. It must disable external networking,
start from an empty allowlisted environment, expose target and tools read-only, permit
writes only to your scratch directory, and apply low CPU, memory, process, file-size,
disk, and wall-clock limits. Isolated loopback is allowed only for a local fixture.
If any control is unavailable, do not execute: return needs_validation with that exact
blocker. Prefer an existing unit test, minimal function harness, dummy-tenant service
call, small malformed fixture, deterministic race schedule, or locally rendered policy.
Do not install or fetch tools.

Record the exact input, command, limits, and minimum result. For the environment,
record only allowlisted variable names and safe non-secret values needed to reproduce
the check. Never capture the ambient environment, inherited variables, credentials,
authentication state, or unrelated host paths. The target-controlled process writes
only in scratch. After the sandbox and all its processes terminate, only trusted
parent-side code may promote predeclared scratch-relative files, following the
promotion procedure block included verbatim in this prompt. You and target code never
write retained artifacts. If promotion is unavailable or fails for decisive evidence,
return needs_validation with the exact promotion blocker.
Never stress availability, invoke a live target, use a real credential, publish an
artifact, or continue past the minimum observed effect.

A deployment, browser, provider, broker, OS, proxy, package, secret, or identity fact
outside source is not proof either way. If one such fact is decisive, return a
needs_validation record with the exact missing observation and safe owner-observed check.
```

```text
Artifact promotion procedure (trusted parent-side code only):
Reference only for you: the parent performs these steps; you never perform them.

Before execution, the parent opens and retains trusted, non-inheritable directory
descriptors for the agent's scratch/ and artifacts/ roots, and records an allowlist
of expected scratch-relative artifact files plus explicit per-file and cumulative
byte limits. Never pass those descriptors to the agent or sandbox. After the sandbox
and all its processes terminate, trusted parent-side code promotes each allowlisted
file separately:

1. Validate the declared relative path: reject absolute, empty, `.`, `..`, or
   symlinked components.
2. Walk each parent component from the retained scratch-root descriptor with
   no-follow directory-relative operations; never reopen by path.
3. Open the leaf no-follow and nonblocking.
4. Verify with `fstat` that it is a regular file with link count exactly one and
   within the recorded per-file and cumulative byte limits.
5. Enforce those limits again while reading from that descriptor.
6. Copy exactly the verified size, repeat `fstat`, and reject a changed identity,
   type, link count, or size.
7. For the destination, walk every parent component from the retained
   artifacts-root descriptor with no-follow directory-relative operations; require
   each existing component to be a real directory, and create any missing directory
   exclusively before reopening and verifying it no-follow.
8. Create the leaf exclusively without following links, verify that the opened
   destination is a regular file with link count exactly one, and copy from the
   verified source descriptor without reopening either path.
9. Use equivalent race-safe APIs on non-POSIX systems.
10. Never recursively copy or glob scratch, extract an archive into artifacts, or
    open or promote a symlink, FIFO, socket, device, directory, hard-linked file,
    changing file, or file that exceeds its bound.
11. If any check is unavailable, cannot be enforced, or fails, discard the scratch
    entry; if it is decisive evidence, retain `needs_validation` with the exact
    promotion blocker.
```

# Core validation rules

```text
## Candidate gate

1. A candidate needs a complete repository-relative source trace and evidence for the
   claimed root cause, including the strongest source-visible control.
2. A proposed confirmed record needs a bounded local observed result, meaningful impact
   across a stated boundary, complete conditions, and no visible preventing layer.
3. Do not strengthen a crash into code execution, ordinary work into shared availability,
   or a same-principal action into privilege gain.
4. If a required fact is not source-visible or locally observable, use
   needs_validation. Name exact blockers; do not give it severity or speculative completion.
5. A missing best practice with no affected principal/resource is excluded or hardening,
   not a finding. A candidate disproved by source is not needs_validation.
6. Use the same source-derived fingerprint for the same root cause in every state.
   It must match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._:/@+-]*$` and must not include a line,
   wave, agent, severity, or verdict.
7. Return an empty candidate array when nothing survives these gates.
```

# Your paths, sandbox and result contract

- Agent ID: `h-access`. Target (read-only): `/home/user/agentbox` at commit 0e4b958. Read source with Read/Grep/Glob or read-only shell. Never edit target files, ledger, architecture, findings, or another agent's directory.
- Your scratch directory (the ONLY place you may write): `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-3/agents/h-access/scratch/`. Retained artifacts: `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-3/agents/h-access/artifacts/` — parent-owned, never write there.
- Approved OS-enforced sandbox for ANY target-controlled execution (importing agentbox modules, running unit tests, harnesses): `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-agentbox/d3718f34-2d87-5ca6-8bcd-dc70a1cecc79/scratchpad/sbx h-access <cmd...>`. Inside it: target at `/target` (read-only, on PYTHONPATH), your scratch at `/scratch` (cwd, writable), no network, no Docker socket, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 1 CPU, 64 pids, 32 MiB files, 120 s. Use `/usr/bin/python3.13` (not `python3`). Example: write `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-3/agents/h-access/scratch/h.py`, then run `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-agentbox/d3718f34-2d87-5ca6-8bcd-dc70a1cecc79/scratchpad/sbx h-access /usr/bin/python3.13 -I /scratch/h.py > /home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-3/agents/h-access/scratch/h.out 2>&1` (note `-I` ignores PYTHONPATH; instead use `/usr/bin/python3.13 -c 'import sys; sys.path.insert(0,"/target"); exec(open("/scratch/h.py").read())'` or omit -I). For pytest: `/usr/bin/python3.13 -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider --basetemp=/scratch/pt -q /target/tests/test_unit.py`.
- Never run agentbox code outside `sbx`. Never use the Docker daemon, start servers, or contact the network. If a claim needs the real Docker-backed control plane or the desktop image at runtime, say so: the parent will reproduce it live during validation. Record such a claim as a candidate with `proposed_verdict: "needs_validation"` and an exact local validation plan, or as `confirmed` only if your sandboxed harness alone demonstrates the boundary result.
- Promotion allowlist: list every scratch-relative file you want retained in a top-level `"artifacts_to_promote": ["h.out", ...]` array in your JSON (max 256 KiB each, 1 MiB total, regular files only). The parent promotes them after you finish; reference them in checks as `agents/h-access/artifacts/<file>`. If you have no local check, use `method: "source"` and `artifact: null`.
- Time box: aim to finish within roughly 40 tool calls. Stop each line of investigation once the invariant is settled.

## Structured hunter result

Return exactly one JSON object, with no surrounding prose:

```json
{
  "units": [
    {
      "coverage_id": "one assigned ID",
      "disposition": "covered|candidate|blocked",
      "reviewed_paths": ["repo/relative/path"],
      "checks": [
        {
          "agent_id": "canonical owner of this check",
          "reviewed_paths": ["repo/relative/path owned by this check"],
          "invariant": "specific control checked for this unit",
          "method": "source|local",
          "result": "what source or the bounded check established",
          "artifact": "agents/<agent-id>/artifacts/file for local, null for source"
        }
      ],
      "candidate_fingerprints": [],
      "unresolved": []
    }
  ],
  "candidates": [],
  "hardening": ["concrete non-finding note"],
  "uncovered": [
    {
      "surface": "...",
      "boundary": "...",
      "subsystem": "...",
      "attack_class": "...",
      "starting_paths": ["repo/relative/path"],
      "reason": "why this needs its own deterministic coverage unit"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each `candidates` entry is schema-shaped except that it uses `proposed_verdict` in place of `verdict`:

- `proposed_verdict: "confirmed"`: include every field required by the `confirmed` branch of `report-schema.json` other than `verdict`: `fingerprint`, title, description, `root_cause`, `intended_behavior`, ordered `trace`, `evidence`, `conditions`, target-neutral `execution`, `remediation`, `severity`, and `confidence`. The execution instructions describe only the bounded local check already performed. `payloads` holds the minimum test input, fixture, or native invocation. `observed_result` records actual local output. Overall severity must not exceed observed impact.
- `proposed_verdict: "needs_validation"`: include every field required by that schema branch other than `verdict`: `fingerprint`, title, description, `claimed_root_cause`, ordered `trace`, `evidence`, nonempty `blockers`, and `validation_plan` with at least one applicable `local` or `deployment` step. Do not invent an inapplicable context. Do not include severity, execution, remediation, reason, or a confirmed `root_cause`. `deployment` is an owner-observed check, not a request to probe a live target.

Every assigned coverage ID appears exactly once in `units`. A `covered` unit needs an owner, nonempty `reviewed_paths` and `checks`, no unresolved fact, and no candidate. A `candidate` unit has the same owned evidence and is the only state that carries linked fingerprints. A `blocked` unit is an owned partial review with nonempty paths, checks, and unresolved facts but no fingerprint. All source paths are repository-relative, never absolute or traversal paths. A trace with several entries begins at `entrypoint`, ends at `sink`, and labels intermediate steps `propagation`. Every check has its own canonical lowercase `agent_id` and nonempty `reviewed_paths`; the unit-level list is exactly the union of those owned paths. A `source` check uses `artifact: null`. A `local` check uses one successfully parent-promoted regular file beneath `agents/<check.agent_id>/artifacts/`; this permits a verifier to add independently owned evidence without taking ownership from the hunter. Never link scratch, an output-root file, or another check owner's artifact.
