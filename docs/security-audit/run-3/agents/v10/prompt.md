You are candidate verifier `v10` in a defensive security audit of agentbox (target /home/user/agentbox, read-only, commit 8e4db9e on main; agentbox/ identical to 0e4b958).


```text
You did not write this candidate. Try to refute it from repository source and bounded
local evidence. Do not contact deployed endpoints or external/shared services. Run
target-controlled code only inside the approved OS-enforced sandbox: no external
network, empty allowlisted environment, read-only target and tools, scratch-only
writes, and explicit low resource and wall-clock limits. If any control is unavailable,
do not execute; retain the exact missing capability as a needs_validation blocker.
Treat every scratch entry as target-controlled after execution. After the sandbox and
all its processes terminate, only trusted parent-side code may promote a predeclared
scratch-relative file, following the promotion procedure block included verbatim in
this prompt. You and target code never write retained artifacts. If promotion is
unavailable or fails, do not use that file as evidence.

1. Verify every trace and evidence file, positive line number, scope, and description.
   Confirm the first entry is a real lower-trust entrypoint and the last is the
   claimed sink or boundary effect.
2. Reconstruct the strongest source-visible validation, identity, authorization,
   normalization, lifecycle, framework, and containment controls on the path.
   Where the architecture summary names a comparable baseline, note whether it
   shares the pattern — as calibration, never as grounds to dismiss.
3. For a proposed confirmed candidate, independently reproduce the minimum observed
   result when possible. Verify inputs, interface shape, conditions, and affected
   dummy principal/resource. Do not infer a stronger result or continue after it.
4. Verify that likelihood, impact, confidence, and the proposed source fix match only
   what the evidence establishes.
5. For a proposed needs_validation candidate, decide whether the blocker is genuinely
   outside source/local observation. If source refutes the trace, reject it. If the
   missing fact remains decisive, keep needs_validation and make the local and
   owner-observed plans exact and non-destructive.
6. Preserve the fingerprint for the same source-derived root cause across every state.

Return exactly one JSON object and no surrounding prose:
{"decision": "confirmed|needs_validation|rejected", "record": { ... }}
where record exactly matches the decision's verdict branch of the schema included
in this prompt. A corrected record replaces the hunter's wording.
```


```text
Artifact promotion procedure (trusted parent-side code only):
Reference only for you: the parent performs these steps; you never perform them.

Before execution, the parent opens and retains trusted, non-inheritable directory
descriptors for the agent's scratch/ and artifacts/ roots, and records an allowlist
of expected scratch-relative artifact files plus explicit per-file and cumulative
byte limits. Never pass those descriptors to the agent or sandbox. After the sandbox
and all its processes terminate, trusted parent-side code promotes each allowlisted
file separately:

1. Validate the declared relative path: reject absolute, empty, `.`, `..`, or
   symlinked components.
2. Walk each parent component from the retained scratch-root descriptor with
   no-follow directory-relative operations; never reopen by path.
3. Open the leaf no-follow and nonblocking.
4. Verify with `fstat` that it is a regular file with link count exactly one and
   within the recorded per-file and cumulative byte limits.
5. Enforce those limits again while reading from that descriptor.
6. Copy exactly the verified size, repeat `fstat`, and reject a changed identity,
   type, link count, or size.
7. For the destination, walk every parent component from the retained
   artifacts-root descriptor with no-follow directory-relative operations; require
   each existing component to be a real directory, and create any missing directory
   exclusively before reopening and verifying it no-follow.
8. Create the leaf exclusively without following links, verify that the opened
   destination is a regular file with link count exactly one, and copy from the
   verified source descriptor without reopening either path.
9. Use equivalent race-safe APIs on non-POSIX systems.
10. Never recursively copy or glob scratch, extract an archive into artifacts, or
    open or promote a symlink, FIFO, socket, device, directory, hard-linked file,
    changing file, or file that exceeds its bound.
11. If any check is unavailable, cannot be enforced, or fails, discard the scratch
    entry; if it is decisive evidence, retain `needs_validation` with the exact
    promotion blocker.

# Parent-live evidence (run by the parent, not by a hunter)

The parent ran the following bounded checks against the real Docker-backed control plane and desktop image (disposable containers, loopback only, dummy tokens) or a real Chromium (playwright-core) on loopback. You cannot run Docker or a browser; treat these as owner-observed local evidence: re-read every script, confirm it exercises the claimed path, and judge whether its output establishes the claim. Say so in your record if the decisive reproduction is the parent's rather than yours.

# Architecture facts

# agentbox architecture summary (run-3)

Source ref: `0e4b958` on `ccr-e10bee8e-6wt669` (PR #5 head; `agentbox/` identical after merge to `main`). Profile `standard`, whole repo.

## 1. Product, principals, protected resources

agentbox is a self-hosted control plane (FastAPI + SQLite) that gives AI agents Docker sandboxes, routes risky tool calls through a human approval queue, and keeps a hash-chained audit log. A desktop mode adds Xvfb/Xfce/noVNC so a human can watch or take over the screen.

- **Human token** `hum_…` (one shared admin secret, `config.py:88-100`): full API.
- **Web UI cookie session**, scope `*` (token login form or one-time `*` ticket): full UI (`web.py:208-242`, `desktop.py`).
- **Desktop-link session**, scope = one sandbox id (redeemed per-sandbox ticket): only that sandbox's desktop page/state/takeover/handback/WS (`api.py:134-140,298-336`, `desktop.py:147-152`).
- **Agent token** `agt_…` per sandbox (hash stored): tool calls on its own sandbox, read own sandbox/approval/desktop state (`api.py:160-230,315`). Lowest-trust network principal; the threat model assumes a prompt-injected agent.
- **Code inside the sandbox**: uid 1000 `agent` (tool execs), uid 1001 `desktop` (X session, GUI tools, x11vnc; member of the agent group, `/workspace` group-writable). Container output (exec stdout, `ps`, `xdotool`, `find -printf` manifest, outbox listings, file names) is attacker-controlled input to the control plane.
- **MCP stdio server / agent.py LLM loop**: hold an agent token; inherit trust from the local launcher.

Protected resources: the human token and approval authority; host filesystem and Docker daemon (control plane holds `docker.sock` = host root); other sandboxes; integrity of `/workspace` restore points (AP-2 snapshots before destructive actions); audit-log integrity and secret masking; control-plane availability (shared thread pool, memory, host disk via `docker commit`).

## 2. Comparable baseline

No source-grounded comparable product. Components: MCP (FastMCP stdio), VNC/RFB via x11vnc+noVNC, gVisor/Kata runtimes. A runc sandbox shares the host kernel; the code refuses runc only when the control plane is exposed (`cli.py:79-115`).

## 3. Stack, deployment, offline limits

Python ≥3.11; fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, jinja2, docker SDK, pyyaml, mcp. Modes: local `agentbox serve` (127.0.0.1), direct TLS, `--behind-tls-proxy` (compose + Caddy, `forwarded_allow_ips="*"` by default), `--insecure`, and the bare `uvicorn agentbox.api:create_app --factory` path that skips serve-time checks. Container flags: `network_mode=none`, `/source` read-only bind, `cap_drop ALL` + CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER/SETUID/SETGID, no-new-privileges, mem/cpu/pids limits; no userns, default seccomp (`sandbox.py:367-388`). Host: Docker 29.9.1, runtimes `runc` and `io.containerd.runc.v2` only (no gVisor/Kata), cgroup v1, images `agentbox-desktop:0.1`, `buildpack-deps:noble-curl`. Pure-function harnesses and the three unit test modules fit the parent's `sbx` sandbox; anything that builds the app needs the Docker daemon (parent-live checks).

## 4. Entry surfaces and important paths

- JSON API `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/tools/{tool}` → `service.call_tool` (per-sandbox concurrency 4, 429) → audit → `policy.decide` → allow / approval queue → `sandbox.exec|read_file|write_file|delete_file|list_dir|gui_*` (`docker exec` as uid 1000/1001), dedicated 32-thread `tool_pool` (`api.py:81`). Exec output streamed and capped (`_Head`, 64 KB).
- Approvals `POST /approvals/{aid}` (human only) → atomic claim → pre-snapshot → run with the agent's original args; terminal approver `cli.py` renders args through `_safe()`.
- Snapshots: `docker commit` before write/delete overwrite and per GUI burst; quota 50 → approval (`service.py:199-204`); per-sandbox `_snap_locks`.
- GUI bursts (`service.py:186-260`): snapshot + manifest + baseline pids at burst start; at close, kill new uid-1001 processes classified by `gui_strays` from root `ps` output and `xdotool` window pids (`sandbox.py:174-225,686-697`), diff `find -printf` manifest (8 MB cap) and log `gui_changes`. Closed on idle from `expire_stale`, `call_tool`, `GET /audit`, UI audit fragment, takeover, end_desktop.
- Files: `read_file` (`timeout` + `[ -f ]` FIFO guard), `outbox_list/read`, `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/files` upload, `source_dir` copy at create (refuses overlap with `settings.home`/DB dir).
- Desktop: tickets (60 s, one-time, hashed), sessions (12 h, hashed, `scope`), leases keyed by public session id `hs_`+32 bits, WS `/desktop/ws` (cookie + same_origin; control needs lease; re-check every 30 s, `session_ended` handback), logout `end_ui_session`.
- Audit: hash chain with append-only triggers, `mask_text` regex set (`audit.py`), UI/CLI timelines render container-controlled strings (`web.py describe`, Jinja autoescape; `cli._safe`).
- Serve: `bind_problem`, `runtime_problem` (literal `"runc"` only), `--allow-runc`/`AGENTBOX_ALLOW_RUNC`.

## 5. Trust boundaries and strongest control

| Boundary | Strongest control |
|---|---|
| Agent → host/other sandboxes | container hardening + runtime (runc here) |
| Agent → approval gate (exec) | `policy.simple_programs` allowlist + `has_bash_comment` + `>` gate |
| Agent → approval gate (GUI) | none by design; burst snapshot, `gui_changes`, stray kill (partial, N-1) |
| Agent → human authority | token kinds, `human_only`, scope checks, source_dir overlap check |
| Agent → control-plane availability | tool_pool, tool_concurrency, `_Head`, snapshot quota, read timeouts |
| Container output → control plane | parsers `_parse_ps`, `_parse_manifest`, `_parse_outbox`; masking; escaping |
| Browser → UI | SameSite=Strict HttpOnly cookie, `same_origin` (missing Origin allowed) |
| Desktop-link session → rest of UI | `scope` column, `desktop_human` |
| Network → control plane | `bind_problem` TLS gate; proxy trust `*` |

## 6. Starting paths

`agentbox/service.py`, `sandbox.py`, `api.py`, `policy.py`, `desktop.py`, `audit.py`, `web.py`, `cli.py`, `config.py`, `approvals.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `agent.py`, `default_policy.yaml`, `images/desktop/`, `deploy/`.

## 7. Prior coverage and revalidation

run-1 (`7fc501f`, standard, source-only) ledger: 15 units; run-2 validated live. 9 confirmed records, all with changed source (fixed in PR #1–#5; N-1 GUI bypass only partially mitigated) → `prior_confirmed_changed_source` revalidation units, not excluded from hunting. One rejected claim (`desktop.py:redeem:sandbox-scoped-ticket-mints-unscoped-full-admin-session`): source changed (scope column), so the unit is current work. No same-source confirmed exclusions. Changed since `7fc501f`: 9 source files (+598/−67) — first priority.

## 8. Companion selection

- `RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md`: agent-driven work consumes the shared pool, memory, host disk.
- `AI-AND-LLM.md`: tool-calling agent behind an approval gate; MCP server; prompt-injection threat model.
- `WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md`: cookie sessions, tickets, login, proxy headers.
- `CLIENT-SIDE.md`: browser UI with htmx and a cookie-authenticated WebSocket.
- `DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md`: x11vnc/docker-exec bridge, uid 1001 desktop helper killed/inspected by the control plane.
- `CLOUD-AND-DEPLOYMENT.md`: container capabilities, runtime selection, compose/proxy precedence.
- `DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md`: snapshots/restore, delete, audit as alternate reader.
- Excluded: `MEMORY-SAFETY-AND-BINARY.md` (no native code in scope), `SUPPLY-CHAIN-AND-RELEASE.md` (no release/signing path; CI only runs tests), `PROTOCOLS-RPC-AND-MESSAGING.md` (no broker/RPC beyond HTTP/WS/MCP stdio covered elsewhere).


# Relevant companion blocks (verbatim)

## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Establish the realistic local or remote-content attacker: another app, another OS user, a sandboxed child, an untrusted document, or a remote origin. Self-harm within the same account and authority is not a boundary violation.
- Paths, process names, bundle/package IDs, and claimed sender fields are not peer authentication. Use OS peer credentials, code identity, capability handles, or protected channel state.
- The native bridge or helper must authorize each operation and final resource after parsing. A trusted UI or broker does not make attacker-influenceable arguments trusted.
- OS sandbox, signing, entitlements, permissions, keychain ACLs, exported-component policy, and prompt behavior are real controls when pinned and visible.
- Use `confirmed` for source evidence plus bounded local/emulator tests. Use `needs_validation` when signing, manifest merge, OS version, device policy, installer ACL, or packaging is required but not observable.
```

## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Name the attacker starting capability, OS/app principal crossed, entry channel, accepted argument or state, and unauthorized operation or disclosure.
2. Confirm OS sandbox, peer credential, signing, entitlement, permission, user-consent, and installer controls that apply. Unknown packaging/runtime facts require `needs_validation`.
3. For webview bridges, cite both navigation/origin control and privileged native sink. For IPC, cite peer authentication and per-resource authorization. For helpers, verify final normalized destination.
4. Keep local tests bounded and use dummy content/accounts. Stop after proving the boundary result; do not extend proof into persistence or broader system modification.
5. Return `confirmed` only with a complete source and local evidence chain. Return `needs_validation` with the exact OS, manifest, signing, ACL, or device-lifecycle fact required.

## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Require an input-to-cost path, a missing effective bound, and impact on another user, shared service, safety function, or operator-owned spend. Self-limiting work in the requester's own process is not a service vulnerability.
- A missing rate limit is not enough. Check body/message/file caps, concurrency, queues, deadlines, database constraints, upstream gateways, and per-tenant quotas before calling a path unbounded.
- Do not run stress, saturation, or production tests. Use asymptotic analysis, small boundary fixtures, mocked paid calls, strict local resource limits, and deterministic cancellation tests.
- State attacker cost, service work, persistence, scope, and recovery. One bounded input with superlinear or persistent shared effect is materially different from sustained volume.
- Use `confirmed` for source-visible bounds failures demonstrated safely. Use `needs_validation` when upstream caps, deployed topology, autoscaling, paid quota, or recovery behavior is outside the repository.
```

## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Name untrusted input, requester work, service amplification or retained resource, shared blast radius, and recovery. Missing limits without concrete shared impact are hardening.
2. Confirm no source-visible upstream, parser, queue, tenant, or framework bound prevents the path. Unknown deployed controls require `needs_validation`.
3. For superlinear behavior, establish the accepted complexity and bounded local growth. For leaks, show repeatable retention after cleanup should occur. For fatal paths, identify process/supervisor isolation.
4. Prioritize by low requester work, unauthenticated reachability, cross-tenant scope, persistence, and poor recovery; do not validate with availability impact.
5. Return `confirmed` only with safe local proof and meaningful shared effect. Return `needs_validation` with the exact upstream limit, topology, quota, or recovery observation an owner must check.

# Execution boundary and paths

- Agent ID `v10`. Write ONLY in `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-3/agents/v10/scratch/`. Never edit target files, the ledger, findings, or other agents' directories.
- Run target code only via `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-agentbox/d3718f34-2d87-5ca6-8bcd-dc70a1cecc79/scratchpad/sbx v10 <cmd...>` (target at /target read-only on PYTHONPATH, scratch at /scratch, no network, no Docker socket, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 1 CPU, 64 pids, 120 s). Use `/usr/bin/python3.13`. jinja2 is not importable there; stub templating if needed.
- If you produce a local artifact, list it in a top-level `"artifacts_to_promote": [...]` field next to `decision` and `record` (scratch-relative; <=256 KiB each); reference it as `agents/v10/artifacts/<file>`.
- No prior record has this fingerprint. Related prior root causes (run-2, all fixed): N-1 GUI tools bypass exec approval (partially mitigated), exec output buffering, threadpool starvation, snapshot quota, source_dir overlap, terminal approval escape spoof.
