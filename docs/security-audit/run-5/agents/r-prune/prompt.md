You are final record verifier `r-prune` in run-5 of a defensive security audit of agentbox. You did not hunt this candidate and you did not perform its Phase 3 validation. You check the STRUCTURED RECORD below, not anyone's write-up.

# Audited source and version

Read-only audited source: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-agentbox/fcd2f048-3e17-52e2-9d78-d39b755653f3/scratchpad/src-audited/` — a git worktree of `main` at commit `346df29`. Every path and line must exist in THAT tree. `/home/user/agentbox` from earlier runs carries different code and must not be used for line numbers.

 "fingerprint": "agentbox/retention.py:prune:archive-unlinked-after-committed-prune-on-interrupt",
 "title": "Interrupted prune deletes the only archive of audit rows it has already committed as pruned",
 "description": "retention.prune writes the archive, then deletes the audit and approval rows and records an audit_anchor holding the archive's sha256, all in one transaction. The inner handler issues ROLLBACK on any exception, and the outer handler unlinks the archive on any BaseException. Neither handler checks whether COMMIT already succeeded. If a KeyboardInterrupt surfaces right after COMMIT returns (Ctrl-C during the fsync-bound COMMIT), the inner ROLLBACK raises OperationalError('cannot rollback - no transaction is active'). The outer handler then deletes the archive. The database says rows 1..N were pruned into an archive with a recorded sha256, and that archive no longer exists. verify() still reports ok with 'pruned through #N'. verify_archives can no longer pass, and a re-run finds nothing to prune. The pruned audit history and its tamper evidence are lost, which contradicts the invariant that a failed prune leaves the database and archive consistent.",
 "root_cause": "The archive cleanup at retention.py:130-131 runs on any exception rather than only when the prune transaction did not commit. The inner handler (retention.py:127-129) runs ROLLBACK unconditionally, even when the transaction has already committed at retention.py:126. Any exception that surfaces after COMMIT therefore both masks itself with a ROLLBACK error and triggers the unlink of the archive that the durable anchor row refers to.",
 "intended_behavior": "The archive is removed only if the prune transaction did not commit. Once the anchor row referencing the archive's sha256 is durable, the archive must be kept whatever exception follows. The failure should be reported as 'pruned; archive kept at <path>'.

# Phase 5 procedure (verbatim)

```text
### Phase 5: Verify the final records with fresh eyes

Launch one fresh `research` verifier per final `confirmed` and `needs_validation` record, in parallel. This verifier checks the structured record, not the hunter write-up, and remains inside source/local boundaries.

In a `quick` run, Phase 3 and Phase 5 merge: the Phase 3 verifier also performs these record checks and returns the final schema-shaped record, so each candidate gets one fresh independent reviewer instead of two. Every other profile keeps the two passes separate. Never skip independent review of a `confirmed` record in any profile.

For `confirmed`, require it to check:

1. Every repository-relative trace/evidence path, line, scope, and described operation.
2. Real entry interface and exact local input shape.
3. Every condition, parser/policy step, source-visible preventing layer, and observed local result.
4. Affected principal/resource and demonstrated impact.
5. Severity separation: realistic likelihood, demonstrated impact, overall no greater than impact.
6. Remediation strategy and any `code_changes`, including whether the fix enforces the invariant without merely moving trust.

For `needs_validation`, require it to check:

1. The source path is real and supports only the `claimed_root_cause` stated.
2. Every listed blocker is decisive and not already answerable locally.
3. The candidate names a boundary and a possible concrete result rather than a generic concern.
4. At least one validation-plan field is present and exact. `local` uses a bounded fixture; `deployment` asks an owner to observe a configuration, identity, route, policy, or runtime fact. Do not invent a plan for an inapplicable context, and never send audit traffic to a deployment.
5. The fingerprint matches prior/current records for the same root cause.

Each verifier returns exactly one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"..."}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`, with no surrounding prose. A replacement record must match its `confirmed`, `needs_validation`, or `rejected` schema branch. Treat a malformed or prose-wrapped Phase 5 result the same way as in Phase 3: discard it without repairing it and re-run with a fresh verifier when the budget permits.

Do not apply a Phase 5 replacement as final when it promotes a record to a stronger verdict, including any promotion to `confirmed`, or materially changes the root cause, trace, execution input or observed result, demonstrated impact, or severity. Give that complete replacement to a new independent verifier that did not hunt, perform Phase 3 validation, or propose the Phase 5 replacement. The new verifier rechecks the current source and independently reproduces any decisive local result under the execution boundary, then returns `verified` or another replacement. Apply a material replacement only after this fresh verification. If another material replacement results, repeat with a fresh verifier. If budget or independence is unavailable, remove the disputed record from `findings.json`, keep its ledger unit as an unresolved candidate, and set `run_status: "incomplete"` with an exact `incomplete_reason`. Non-material wording or repository-line corrections may be applied directly when they do not change meaning or evidence.

After every applied replacement, rerun both validators and update linked ledger decisions. If a final verifier identifies a separate root cause, assign a new fingerprint and send it through independent candidate validation before inclusion. Set `run_status: "complete"` only when every ledger candidate has an independent final disposition and every retained record passes Phase 5.

Do not verify only `confirmed` records. A misleading `needs_validation` handoff wastes owner time and can preserve a false premise.

# Architecture facts (summary; re-check every line you rely on)

# agentbox architecture summary (run-5)

Source ref: `346df29` (`main`, after fix PRs #16-#23). Profile `standard`, focused follow-up, budget 30. This file is the run-4 architecture (built at `9805d91` from recon-1a..1d) plus a parent-written delta in section 0. No reconnaissance agent was spent in run-5: the parent re-read every file changed since `9805d91` (15 files, +712/-148 in `agentbox/`). **Line numbers in sections 1-8 are run-4 (`9805d91`) numbers and are approximate in this tree; section 0 numbers are current.**

## 0. Run-5 delta (current line numbers, `346df29`)

- **Body cap (F1 fix, PR #16).** `api.py:89-148` `_BodyLimit` pure-ASGI middleware, added at `api.py:170`, runs before routing and auth for every `http` scope (not `websocket`). Cap = `max_upload_body_bytes` (`AGENTBOX_MAX_UPLOAD_BODY`, 256 MiB) when `POST` and path fullmatches `/sandboxes/[^/]+/files` (`api.py:86`), else `max_body_bytes` (`AGENTBOX_MAX_BODY`, 8 MiB) (`config.py:65-66`). Content-Length over cap or non-digit → 413 without reading; streamed bodies are counted in `limited_receive` and cut with a fake `http.disconnect`. Upload route `api.py:335-352` authenticates (`screen_human`) then reads `request.form()` and each file with `read(limit+1)` (`max_upload_bytes` 50 MiB). `deploy/Caddyfile` adds `request_body` caps. `web.py` has its own upload form (`web.py:~229`).
- **Audit cap (F3 fix, PR #16).** `audit.py:126-152` `_bound`/`bound_payload` bound every payload before hashing (strings 64 KiB, lists 200, row 128 KiB); `AuditLog.append` (`audit.py:281`).
- **GUI gate (F2) and quota recheck (F7), PR #17.** `_run_tool` refuses GUI input without an open burst (`GuiBursts.covers`, `gui_bursts.py:68`); allow-path commit rechecks `_over_snapshot_quota` (`service.py:254`) and logs `tool_blocked`/`snapshot_quota_changed`.
- **Lifecycle lock (F6), F4, F5, F8, PR #18.** `AgentBox._lifecycle` (`service.py:500`) serialises pause/resume/snapshot/restore/delete per sandbox; `SandboxManager.restore` refuses `deleted`. Preview `_expand`/`_walk` use NUL-separated output. `extract_novnc` (`sandbox_desktop.py:174`) single-flight with 60 s negative cache. Login failures rate-logged (`web.py:102-114`, 5/min + `suppressed_before`); token compare on bytes.
- **Control-character filter (N5, PR #19).** `display.escape_controls` escapes Unicode categories Cc/Cf/Zl/Zp; shared by `web._shown` and `cli._safe`.
- **Disk guard and approval compaction (N2 stage 1, PR #20).** `AgentBox.disk_low` (`service.py:388-404`) uses `shutil.disk_usage(db_path.parent).free < min_free_bytes` (`AGENTBOX_MIN_FREE`, 256 MiB; 0 disables); `call_tool` (`service.py:279-285`) refuses **agent** calls with 507; `api.py:313` skips the agent `approval_forbidden` row while low; state changes log `disk_low`/`disk_ok` only on transitions. `_finish` (`service.py:406-411`) rewrites finished approval rows' `args` with `_logged_args` (size/sha256/16 KiB head) and `preview` with `bound_payload` via `ApprovalStore.finish(..., args, preview)` (`approvals.py:91-100`, `COALESCE`). Pending rows still hold raw args/preview (`approvals.py:49-59`). `decide` maps a `claim` `sqlite3.Error` to 503; `expire_stale` (`service.py:422-438`) returns on `sqlite3.Error`. `_approvals.html` shows `args.args_head` for compacted rows.
- **Prune and anchor (N2 stage 2, PR #21).** `retention.py` (new): `prune(db_path, before, archive, dry_run)` — host CLI only (`cli.py:319` `cmd_prune`, `agentbox prune --before --archive [--dry-run]`), never HTTP. Plan: audit rows with `id < MIN(id WHERE ts >= cutoff)`, approvals with status in denied/executed/failed/expired and `created_at < cutoff` (`retention.py:54-64`). Archive written outside the DB lock with `open(path, "xb")` + gzip + fsync, sha256 (`:67-84`). Then `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`: concurrent-prune check, `DROP TRIGGER audit_no_delete`, `DELETE`, recreate trigger from `NO_DELETE_SQL`, insert `audit_anchor` row (always, even approvals-only), delete approvals, `insert_record(... "audit_pruned" ...)`, `COMMIT`; on any exception rollback and unlink the archive (`:105-132`). `audit.py`: `audit_anchor` table with no-update/no-delete triggers (`:44-55`), `latest_anchor:178`, `check_chain:184`, `read_archive:208` (gzip JSON Lines, header format check), `insert_record:228` (chains from last row else latest anchor else GENESIS; `append` uses it), `verify:336` (starts at latest anchor; anchor + empty table fails), `verify_archives:351` (GENESIS → each archive must match its anchor's sha256/last row → live table). `cli.py:299` `cmd_verify --archive` runs `verify_archives` locally against `Settings().db_path`. Known limit (README): anchor lives in the same DB, so a DB writer can forge it.
- **Window owner via XRes (N4, PR #22).** `sandbox_desktop.py:42-75` `_WINDOW_OWNERS` ctypes script (libX11 + libXRes `XResQueryClientIds` mask 2 → `XResGetClientPid`); `desktop_processes` (`:77-~95`) runs `sh -c 'xdotool search --onlyvisible --name . 2>/dev/null | xargs -r /usr/bin/python3 -I -c "$0"' <script>` as the desktop user inside the container; nonzero exit → no window pids (fail-closed: more strays). `gui_state._new_processes:53` returns `(stray, kept)`; `gui_kept:95`. `gui_bursts._stop_strays:89` stores `_kept[sid] = (container_id, pids)` and logs `gui_processes_kept`; `open:73` removes kept pids from the next baseline when the container id matches.
- **Docs (PR #23).** LLM-provider data path documented as an accepted limitation; out of scope for hunting.

Unchanged since run-4 and not re-hunted: N1 (`same_origin` scheme) and N3 (container output readers) remain needs_validation.

## 1. Product, principals, protected resources

agentbox is a self-hosted FastAPI + SQLite control plane. It gives AI agents Docker sandboxes, routes risky tool calls through a human approval queue, and keeps a hash-chained audit log. Desktop templates add Xvfb/Xfce/x11vnc/noVNC so a human can watch or take over the screen.

- **Human token** `hum_…` (one shared admin secret, `config.py:88-100`): full JSON API (`api.py:115` `principal`).
- **Browser cookie session**, scope `*` (login form or one-time `*` ticket): full UI. Sessions and tickets carry a `gen` fingerprint of the human token, so rotation revokes them (`desktop.py`).
- **Desktop-link session**, scope = one sandbox id: only that sandbox's desktop page/state/takeover/handback/WS (`api.py:157` `desktop_human`).
- **Agent token** `agt_…` per sandbox (hash stored): tools on its own sandbox, read own sandbox/approval/desktop state. Lowest-trust network principal; the threat model assumes a prompt-injected agent.
- **Code inside the sandbox**: uid 1000 `agent` (exec, file tools) and uid 1001 `desktop` (X session, GUI tools, x11vnc; in the agent group). Every container output (exec stdout, `ps`, `xdotool`, `find -printf` manifest, outbox listing, `ls`, preview `_expand`/`_walk`, screenshot bytes, RFB stream) is attacker data to the control plane.
- **Unauthenticated network clients**: `/`, `/login` (GET/POST; failed POST writes an audit row), `/static/htmx.min.js`, `/static/novnc/*` (`api.py:356`, may create a container via `extract_novnc`), `/healthz`, ticket redemption, FastAPI `/docs`.
- **MCP stdio server / `agent.py` loop**: hold an agent token; trust the local launcher.

Protected resources: the human token and approval authority; host filesystem and Docker daemon (the control plane holds `docker.sock` = host root); other sandboxes; `/workspace` restore points (snapshots before destructive actions and per GUI burst); audit-log integrity and secret masking; control-plane availability (thread pools, memory, SQLite, host disk via `docker commit`).

## 2. Comparable baseline

No source-grounded comparable product. Components: MCP (FastMCP/MCPServer stdio), RFB via x11vnc `-inetd` + socat + noVNC, gVisor/Kata named as preferred runtimes. A runc sandbox shares the host kernel.

## 3. Stack, deployment, offline limits

Python ≥3.11; fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, jinja2, docker SDK, pyyaml, mcp. Modes: `agentbox serve` (127.0.0.1 default; `bind_problem` and `runtime_problem` gates, `cli.py:68-111`; `runtime_problem` rejects only the literal `"runc"`), compose + Caddy with `--behind-tls-proxy` and `forwarded_allow_ips="*"` by default (`cli.py:124-126`), and the bare `create_app` factory (`api.py:376`) that skips the serve-time gates. Container flags (`sandbox.py:243-265`): `network_mode=none`, non-recursive read-only `/source` bind, `cap_drop ALL` + CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER/SETUID/SETGID, no-new-privileges, mem/cpu/pids limits, no userns, default seccomp. The desktop start script resets `/home/desktop` on every start and restore (v19 fix).

Host for this run: Docker 29.9.1, runtimes `runc`/`io.containerd.runc.v2` only, cgroup v1, images `ubuntu:24.04`, `buildpack-deps:noble-curl`, `agentbox-desktop:0.1` (rebuilt from this tree). Agent-run code goes through `tools/sbx` (no network, read-only target, 256 MiB loop scratch, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 64 pids, 120 s; `agentbox.web`/`api` importable). Docker-free tests: `tests/test_unit.py`, `test_m2_unit.py`, `test_m4_unit.py`; fakes for `GuiBursts`/`AgentBox` in `test_m2_unit.py`. Anything needing the real daemon is a parent-live check.

## 4. Entry surfaces and important paths

- **Tools**: `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/tools/{tool}` → `AgentBox.call_tool` (`service.py:268`, per-sandbox concurrency 4, `_snap_locks`) → `_call_tool` (`service.py:290`: audit with capped args `_logged_args:181` → `policy.decide` → quota → approval or `_snapshot:250` → `_run_tool`) on the 32-thread `tool_pool` (`api.py:103`). Pending approvals capped at 20 (`service.py:44`).
- **Approvals**: `POST /approvals/{aid}` / `POST /ui/approvals/...` (human) → `decide` (`service.py:389`): atomic claim, snapshot, run stored args. Runs on the Starlette threadpool, outside `tool_pool`, `_busy` and `_snap_locks`. Preview (`preview.py:67` `preview_command` with `_expand`/`_walk` callbacks, `sandbox.py:557-569`) and capture run before the approval exists.
- **Lifecycle** (refactor PR 1): `pause_sandbox/resume_sandbox/snapshot_sandbox/restore_sandbox/delete_sandbox` (`service.py:444-475`), called by `api.py` and `web.py` inside `guard`. Restore: log → `end_desktop` → `sandboxes.restore` → `bursts.reset_timers` → log. Delete: log → `end_desktop` → delete → `drop_captures`. Pause: log → `bursts.end` → pause. None takes `gui_lock` or `_snap_locks`.
- **GUI bursts** (`gui_bursts.py:23`, refactor PR 2): `needs_snapshot:52`, `open:65` (fail-closed baseline, bound to `container_id`), `close:100`/`_finish:113` (stray kill via `gui_state.gui_strays` from root `ps` + `_NET_WM_PID`, manifest diff → `gui_changes`), `close_idle:137` on a dedicated pool from `expire_stale` callers, `end:157`. Timestamps `_gui_input_at`/`_gui_snap_at` are written without a lock.
- **Desktop**: tickets (60 s, one-time, hashed), sessions (12 h, scoped), leases; takeover/handback (`service.py:503,523`, `bursts.close` under `gui_lock`); WS route `api.py:344` (cookie, `same_origin` with missing Origin allowed, mode, `may_connect`) → `desktop_ws.relay:18` (no auth of its own; session re-check every 30 s; x11vnc without `-noremote`/`-safer`).
- **Files**: `read_file`/`write_file`/`delete_file`/`list_dir` (`safe_path`), upload, outbox list/read; `list_dir`, `exists`, `is_dir`, `outbox_list`, `_expand` run `exec_run` with no container-side timeout and full buffering.
- **Rendering**: Jinja autoescape + `finalize=_shown` → `display.escape_controls:18` (shared with `cli._safe`); `_NoFraming` middleware (`api.py:63`) on HTTP responses.
- **Audit**: hash chain + append-only triggers, `mask_text`; `log_human` fails closed with 503 (`service.py:590`); tool results and burst records are best-effort.

## 5. Trust boundaries and strongest control

| Boundary | Strongest control |
|---|---|
| Agent → host/other sandboxes | container hardening + runtime (runc on this host) |
| Agent → approval gate (exec) | `policy.simple_programs` allowlist + `has_bash_comment` + `>`/`$` gate |
|

<!-- DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md#Core discipline -->
## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- A tenant or owner field on a record is not isolation. Find the query, key, path, policy, or row-level control that enforces it for each read and write path.
- Trace derived copies. Sanitized primary data can become unsafe in search, cache, analytics, export, previews, logs, replicas, and backups with different ACL and retention rules.
- Deletion and revocation are lifecycle contracts. Check current, historical, cached, indexed, exported, restored, and queued copies within the product's stated boundary.
- Privacy or retention preference is not automatically a security vulnerability. Require an explicit data-access boundary or deletion/revocation guarantee and an unauthorized reader or later operation.
- Use `confirmed` for complete source-visible lineage and bounded dummy-tenant tests. Use `needs_validation` when external storage policy, retention, CDN behavior, replica lag, or backup access is unavailable.
```

<!-- DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md#Export and backup scope expansion -->
**Export and backup scope expansion**
An export, snapshot, portability package, report, or backup includes other tenants, inaccessible object fields, soft-deleted data, secret values, or history above the requester's access. Check per-item authorization after selection and authorization to download the final artifact.

<!-- DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md#Soft-delete and tombstone bypass -->
**Soft-delete and tombstone bypass**
Direct lookup, search, relation traversal, object link, background processor, or restore ignores the lifecycle predicate and returns or acts on a deleted/revoked record. Check whether soft-deleted identifiers can be re-registered before all references are gone.

<!-- DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md#Universal moves -->
## Universal moves (apply across the above)

- Pick one protected record and draw primary write, query, cache, index, event, export, backup, deletion, and restore paths. Mark principal and tenant at every edge.
- Compare two dummy tenants through the same local service methods, then repeat after ACL change, deletion, account switch, and restore. Do not use real user data.
- Start at bypass clients, background jobs, migrations, global uniqueness, and cache keys. These paths commonly omit request-scoped identity that interactive endpoints carry.

<!-- DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md#Validation rules -->
## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Name attacker or lower-trust principal, protected data/state, affected owner/tenant, alternate copy or operation, and unauthorized disclosure or mutation.
2. Cite both intended source-of-truth policy and the path that omits or disagrees with it. Confirm another layer does not enforce the same tenant/lifecycle condition.
3. Use local dummy tenants and non-sensitive fixtures to prove cross-scope access or stale lifecycle behavior. Stop at the minimum observable record or operation.
4. If external cache, object storage, replicas, analytics, backup, or retention policy is required, classify `needs_validation` and state the owner-observed check.
5. Return `confirmed` only with complete lineage and concrete boundary impact. Return `needs_validation` with the exact unresolved storage, ACL, invalidation, retention, or restore fact.

<!-- DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md#Local file ownership and TOCTOU -->
**Local file ownership and TOCTOU**
The app checks a file/path then follows replacement, symlink, mount, or case/normalization changes during a privileged read/write. Use descriptor-relative operations and verify final ownership. Focus `MEMORY-SAFETY-AND-BINARY.md` on parsing after the file is opened.

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Decompression and representation amplification -->
**Decompression and representation amplification**
Compressed, sparse, nested, aliased, or encoded input expands far beyond the checked transfer or file size. Verify limits after every expansion and across parser stages, including archives, images, fonts, structured documents, and protocol compression tables.

# Execution boundary and paths

- Agent ID `r-prune`. Write ONLY in `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-5/agents/r-prune/scratch/`. Never edit target files, the ledger, findings, architecture or another agent's directory.
- Run target-controlled code only through `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-5/tools/sbx r-prune <cmd...>`: audited source read-only at /target (on PYTHONPATH), scratch at /scratch, no network, no Docker socket, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 1 CPU, 64 pids, 32 MiB files, 120 s. Use `/usr/bin/python3.13`.
- Unit tests need cwd=/target: `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-5/tools/sbx r-prune /usr/bin/sh -c "cd /target && /usr/bin/python3.13 -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider --capture=sys -q tests/test_unit.py"`.
- If you produce a local artifact, list it in a top-level `"artifacts_to_promote": [...]` field (scratch-relative, <=256 KiB each). The parent promotes it after you finish.
- Your final message must be ONLY one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"agentbox/retention.py:prune:archive-unlinked-after-committed-prune-on-interrupt"}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`. No prose, no code fence.
