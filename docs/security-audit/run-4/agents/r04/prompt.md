You are final record verifier `r04` in run-4 of a defensive security audit of agentbox. You did not hunt this candidate and you did not perform its Phase 3 validation. You check the STRUCTURED RECORD below, not anyone's write-up.

# Audited source and version

Read-only audited source: `<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/temp/agentbox-run4/src-audited/` — a git worktree of `main` at commit `9805d91`. Every path and line must exist in THAT tree. `/home/user/agentbox` from earlier runs carries different code and must not be used for line numbers.

 "verdict": "needs_validation",
 "fingerprint": "agentbox/sandbox.py:container-output-readers-without-_Head-byte-cap",
 "title": "list_dir, outbox_list, preview glob expansion and screenshot buffer unbounded container output in the shared control-plane process",
 "description": "On a sandbox that the agent token controls, four control-plane readers take the whole container-produced stream through Docker's non-streaming exec_run, with no byte cap and, for three of them, no container-side timeout: SandboxManager.list_dir (sandbox.py:428) runs `ls -la` on any /workspace or /source path; SandboxManager.outbox_list (sandbox.py:534) runs an unbounded `find -maxdepth 1 -printf`; SandboxManager._expand (sandbox.py:560) globs a preview pattern; DesktopTools.screenshot (sandbox_desktop.py:86-88) `cat`s /home/desktop/.cache/agentbox-shot.png and only then checks the PNG magic. _truncate (sandbox_common.py:24-32) and _parse_outbox (sandbox.py:111-124) run after the whole buffer exists, so they bound the returned value, not the peak. The peak is paid by the one shared FastAPI process, so one sandbox's listing is charged to every sandbox. Measured locally against the real reader functions with a fake exec_run: a 16 MiB stream makes list_dir peak at 16.19 MiB, against 0.32 MiB for exec's _Head reader on the same stream; 5.0 MB of find output becomes 58.6 MiB retained and 72.6 MiB peak after _parse_outbox (12.3x, record count uncapped); 4.2 MB of glob output becomes 209,715 Python strings; an 8 MiB PNG is accepted unchanged and then base64-encoded to 11.2 MB for the agent response (service.py:143). The screenshot path is the one with superlinear amplitude: the shot file sits in the desktop user's writable home (_SHOT, sandbox_desktop.py:32), so uid 1001 can point it at a character device and turn one cheap call into up to 15 s of unthrottled `cat`, bounded only by a wall clock (_X_TIMEOUT, sandbox_desktop.py:26,46-50), whose exit-code check also runs after the read. The host-disk half of the claim is narrower than proposed: service.py:328 writes the captured PNG with no size check, but only after the magic test passes, so a /dev/zero symlink costs memory and no disk; a huge PNG-prefixed file is needed for the disk variant. The list_dir/outbox_list/_expand variants are ~1:1 with container output, and the container's output ceiling is its writable layer, which the repository caps only when the optional AGENTBOX_DISK is set (config.py:42, sandbox.py:263-264).",
 "claimed_root_cause": "The _Head/_OUT_LIMIT discipline for exec and the container-side _timed plus head -c discipline for read_file, outbox_read and workspace_manifest were applied reader by reader; four readers that consume attacker-selected container output were left with a plain exec_run read (sandbox.py:428, 534, 560 and sandbox_desktop.py:86-88), and the screenshot reader's only bound is a timeout that is checked after the full read.",

# Phase 5 procedure (verbatim)

```text
### Phase 5: Verify the final records with fresh eyes

Launch one fresh `research` verifier per final `confirmed` and `needs_validation` record, in parallel. This verifier checks the structured record, not the hunter write-up, and remains inside source/local boundaries.

In a `quick` run, Phase 3 and Phase 5 merge: the Phase 3 verifier also performs these record checks and returns the final schema-shaped record, so each candidate gets one fresh independent reviewer instead of two. Every other profile keeps the two passes separate. Never skip independent review of a `confirmed` record in any profile.

For `confirmed`, require it to check:

1. Every repository-relative trace/evidence path, line, scope, and described operation.
2. Real entry interface and exact local input shape.
3. Every condition, parser/policy step, source-visible preventing layer, and observed local result.
4. Affected principal/resource and demonstrated impact.
5. Severity separation: realistic likelihood, demonstrated impact, overall no greater than impact.
6. Remediation strategy and any `code_changes`, including whether the fix enforces the invariant without merely moving trust.

For `needs_validation`, require it to check:

1. The source path is real and supports only the `claimed_root_cause` stated.
2. Every listed blocker is decisive and not already answerable locally.
3. The candidate names a boundary and a possible concrete result rather than a generic concern.
4. At least one validation-plan field is present and exact. `local` uses a bounded fixture; `deployment` asks an owner to observe a configuration, identity, route, policy, or runtime fact. Do not invent a plan for an inapplicable context, and never send audit traffic to a deployment.
5. The fingerprint matches prior/current records for the same root cause.

Each verifier returns exactly one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"..."}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`, with no surrounding prose. A replacement record must match its `confirmed`, `needs_validation`, or `rejected` schema branch. Treat a malformed or prose-wrapped Phase 5 result the same way as in Phase 3: discard it without repairing it and re-run with a fresh verifier when the budget permits.

Do not apply a Phase 5 replacement as final when it promotes a record to a stronger verdict, including any promotion to `confirmed`, or materially changes the root cause, trace, execution input or observed result, demonstrated impact, or severity. Give that complete replacement to a new independent verifier that did not hunt, perform Phase 3 validation, or propose the Phase 5 replacement. The new verifier rechecks the current source and independently reproduces any decisive local result under the execution boundary, then returns `verified` or another replacement. Apply a material replacement only after this fresh verification. If another material replacement results, repeat with a fresh verifier. If budget or independence is unavailable, remove the disputed record from `findings.json`, keep its ledger unit as an unresolved candidate, and set `run_status: "incomplete"` with an exact `incomplete_reason`. Non-material wording or repository-line corrections may be applied directly when they do not change meaning or evidence.

After every applied replacement, rerun both validators and update linked ledger decisions. If a final verifier identifies a separate root cause, assign a new fingerprint and send it through independent candidate validation before inclusion. Set `run_status: "complete"` only when every ledger candidate has an independent final disposition and every retained record passes Phase 5.

Do not verify only `confirmed` records. A misleading `needs_validation` handoff wastes owner time and can preserve a false premise.

# Architecture facts (summary; re-check every line you rely on)

# agentbox architecture summary (run-4)

Source ref: `9805d91` (`main`, after refactor PRs #11-#14). Profile `standard`, whole repo, budget 50. Built from recon-1a..1d (`agents/recon-*/result.md`). Line numbers below were re-checked by the parent; recon-1b and recon-1c cite some `api.py`, `web.py` and `preview.py` lines that do not exist in this tree, so treat their numbers as approximate.

## 1. Product, principals, protected resources

agentbox is a self-hosted FastAPI + SQLite control plane. It gives AI agents Docker sandboxes, routes risky tool calls through a human approval queue, and keeps a hash-chained audit log. Desktop templates add Xvfb/Xfce/x11vnc/noVNC so a human can watch or take over the screen.

- **Human token** `hum_…` (one shared admin secret, `config.py:88-100`): full JSON API (`api.py:115` `principal`).
- **Browser cookie session**, scope `*` (login form or one-time `*` ticket): full UI. Sessions and tickets carry a `gen` fingerprint of the human token, so rotation revokes them (`desktop.py`).
- **Desktop-link session**, scope = one sandbox id: only that sandbox's desktop page/state/takeover/handback/WS (`api.py:157` `desktop_human`).
- **Agent token** `agt_…` per sandbox (hash stored): tools on its own sandbox, read own sandbox/approval/desktop state. Lowest-trust network principal; the threat model assumes a prompt-injected agent.
- **Code inside the sandbox**: uid 1000 `agent` (exec, file tools) and uid 1001 `desktop` (X session, GUI tools, x11vnc; in the agent group). Every container output (exec stdout, `ps`, `xdotool`, `find -printf` manifest, outbox listing, `ls`, preview `_expand`/`_walk`, screenshot bytes, RFB stream) is attacker data to the control plane.
- **Unauthenticated network clients**: `/`, `/login` (GET/POST; failed POST writes an audit row), `/static/htmx.min.js`, `/static/novnc/*` (`api.py:356`, may create a container via `extract_novnc`), `/healthz`, ticket redemption, FastAPI `/docs`.
- **MCP stdio server / `agent.py` loop**: hold an agent token; trust the local launcher.

Protected resources: the human token and approval authority; host filesystem and Docker daemon (the control plane holds `docker.sock` = host root); other sandboxes; `/workspace` restore points (snapshots before destructive actions and per GUI burst); audit-log integrity and secret masking; control-plane availability (thread pools, memory, SQLite, host disk via `docker commit`).

## 2. Comparable baseline

No source-grounded comparable product. Components: MCP (FastMCP/MCPServer stdio), RFB via x11vnc `-inetd` + socat + noVNC, gVisor/Kata named as preferred runtimes. A runc sandbox shares the host kernel.

## 3. Stack, deployment, offline limits

Python ≥3.11; fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, jinja2, docker SDK, pyyaml, mcp. Modes: `agentbox serve` (127.0.0.1 default; `bind_problem` and `runtime_problem` gates, `cli.py:68-111`; `runtime_problem` rejects only the literal `"runc"`), compose + Caddy with `--behind-tls-proxy` and `forwarded_allow_ips="*"` by default (`cli.py:124-126`), and the bare `create_app` factory (`api.py:376`) that skips the serve-time gates. Container flags (`sandbox.py:243-265`): `network_mode=none`, non-recursive read-only `/source` bind, `cap_drop ALL` + CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER/SETUID/SETGID, no-new-privileges, mem/cpu/pids limits, no userns, default seccomp. The desktop start script resets `/home/desktop` on every start and restore (v19 fix).

Host for this run: Docker 29.9.1, runtimes `runc`/`io.containerd.runc.v2` only, cgroup v1, images `ubuntu:24.04`, `buildpack-deps:noble-curl`, `agentbox-desktop:0.1` (rebuilt from this tree). Agent-run code goes through `tools/sbx` (no network, read-only target, 256 MiB loop scratch, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 64 pids, 120 s; `agentbox.web`/`api` importable). Docker-free tests: `tests/test_unit.py`, `test_m2_unit.py`, `test_m4_unit.py`; fakes for `GuiBursts`/`AgentBox` in `test_m2_unit.py`. Anything needing the real daemon is a parent-live check.

## 4. Entry surfaces and important paths

- **Tools**: `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/tools/{tool}` → `AgentBox.call_tool` (`service.py:268`, per-sandbox concurrency 4, `_snap_locks`) → `_call_tool` (`service.py:290`: audit with capped args `_logged_args:181` → `policy.decide` → quota → approval or `_snapshot:250` → `_run_tool`) on the 32-thread `tool_pool` (`api.py:103`). Pending approvals capped at 20 (`service.py:44`).
- **Approvals**: `POST /approvals/{aid}` / `POST /ui/approvals/...` (human) → `decide` (`service.py:389`): atomic claim, snapshot, run stored args. Runs on the Starlette threadpool, outside `tool_pool`, `_busy` and `_snap_locks`. Preview (`preview.py:67` `preview_command` with `_expand`/`_walk` callbacks, `sandbox.py:557-569`) and capture run before the approval exists.
- **Lifecycle** (refactor PR 1): `pause_sandbox/resume_sandbox/snapshot_sandbox/restore_sandbox/delete_sandbox` (`service.py:444-475`), called by `api.py` and `web.py` inside `guard`. Restore: log → `end_desktop` → `sandboxes.restore` → `bursts.reset_timers` → log. Delete: log → `end_desktop` → delete → `drop_captures`. Pause: log → `bursts.end` → pause. None takes `gui_lock` or `_snap_locks`.
- **GUI bursts** (`gui_bursts.py:23`, refactor PR 2): `needs_snapshot:52`, `open:65` (fail-closed baseline, bound to `container_id`), `close:100`/`_finish:113` (stray kill via `gui_state.gui_strays` from root `ps` + `_NET_WM_PID`, manifest diff → `gui_changes`), `close_idle:137` on a dedicated pool from `expire_stale` callers, `end:157`. Timestamps `_gui_input_at`/`_gui_snap_at` are written without a lock.
- **Desktop**: tickets (60 s, one-time, hashed), sessions (12 h, scoped), leases; takeover/handback (`service.py:503,523`, `bursts.close` under `gui_lock`); WS route `api.py:344` (cookie, `same_origin` with missing Origin allowed, mode, `may_connect`) → `desktop_ws.relay:18` (no auth of its own; session re-check every 30 s; x11vnc without `-noremote`/`-safer`).
- **Files**: `read_file`/`write_file`/`delete_file`/`list_dir` (`safe_path`), upload, outbox list/read; `list_dir`, `exists`, `is_dir`, `outbox_list`, `_expand` run `exec_run` with no container-side timeout and full buffering.
- **Rendering**: Jinja autoescape + `finalize=_shown` → `display.escape_controls:18` (shared with `cli._safe`); `_NoFraming` middleware (`api.py:63`) on HTTP responses.
- **Audit**: hash chain + append-only triggers, `mask_text`; `log_human` fails closed with 503 (`service.py:590`); tool results and burst records are best-effort.

## 5. Trust boundaries and strongest control

| Boundary | Strongest control |
|---|---|
| Agent → host/other sandboxes | container hardening + runtime (runc on this host) |
| Agent → approval gate (exec) | `policy.simple_programs` allowlist + `has_bash_comment` + `>`/`$` gate |
| Agent → approval gate (GUI) | none by design; burst snapshot, fail-closed open, `gui_changes`, stray kill (N-1 partial) |
| Agent → human authority | token kinds, `human_only`, scope checks, `samefile` source_dir overlap check |
| Agent → control-plane availability | `tool_pool`, tool concurrency, `_Head`, snapshot quota, pending cap, `_timed` X/manifest execs |
| Container output → control plane | `_parse_ps`, `_parse_manifest`, `_parse_outbox`, preview parsing; masking; escaping |
| Browser → UI | SameSite=Strict HttpOnly cookie, `same_origin`, XFO/frame-ancestors |
| Desktop-link session → rest of UI | `scope`, `desktop_human` |
| Network → control plane | `bind_problem`; proxy trust `*`; unauthenticated login/novnc routes |

## 6. Starting paths

`agentbox/service.py`, `gui_bursts.py`, `gui_state.py`, `sandbox.py`, `sandbox_desktop.py`, `sandbox_common.py`, `preview.py`, `api.py`, `desktop_ws.py`, `web.py`, `display.py`, `desktop.py`, `policy.py`, `audit.py`, `approvals.py`, `cli.py`, `config.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `agent.py`, `default_policy.yaml`, `templates/`, `images/desktop/`, `deploy/`.

## 7. Prior coverage and revalidation

Prior ledgers: run-1 (`7fc501f`) and run-3 (`0e4b958`/`8e4db9e`, incomplete, 29 units); run-2 validated run-1 live. Every run-3 confirmed record (11) was fixed and the refactor moved the code, so all are `prior_confirmed_changed_source` revalidation units, not hunter exclusions. Five run-3 `needs_validation` records (v01 same_origin scheme, v09 burst open, v10 gui_lock, v14 framing, v15 `gui_strays` window ownership) are current work. Three critic-3 units deferred in run-3 (GUI-burst state races, disk/SQLite pressure, pre-auth work) are current work. Two rejected claims (runc alias, backgrounded-children pid exhaustion) suppress only those exact claims. No same-source confirmed exclusions. Recon-flagged seams: lifecycle methods without `gui_lock`/`_snap_locks`, `decide` outside the snapshot lock, synchronous burst closes on human threads, unbounded/untimed preview and listing execs, error/preview strings that bypass the audit arg cap, unauthenticated audit growth, x11vnc remote-control plus `from_exec` stray exemption, root `/tmp` operations in the desktop start script.

## 8. Companion selection

- `RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md`: agent work consumes shared pools, memory, SQLite and host disk.
- `AI-AND-LLM.md`: tool-calling agent behind an approval gate; MCP server; prompt-injection threat model.
- `WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md`: cookie sessions, tickets, login, proxy headers.

## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Require an input-to-cost path, a missing effective bound, and impact on another user, shared service, safety function, or operator-owned spend. Self-limiting work in the requester's own process is not a service vulnerability.
- A missing rate limit is not enough. Check body/message/file caps, concurrency, queues, deadlines, database constraints, upstream gateways, and per-tenant quotas before calling a path unbounded.
- Do not run stress, saturation, or production tests. Use asymptotic analysis, small boundary fixtures, mocked paid calls, strict local resource limits, and deterministic cancellation tests.
- State attacker cost, service work, persistence, scope, and recovery. One bounded input with superlinear or persistent shared effect is materially different from sustained volume.
- Use `confirmed` for source-visible bounds failures demonstrated safely. Use `needs_validation` when upstream caps, deployed topology, autoscaling, paid quota, or recovery behavior is outside the repository.
```

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Unbounded buffering and cardinality -->
**Unbounded buffering and cardinality**
Bodies, out-of-order streams, uploads, sessions, unique cache keys, metrics labels, log fields, subscriptions, or pending jobs accumulate without per-item and aggregate limits. Find cleanup and expiration on disconnect, timeout, cancellation, and partial parse.

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#File descriptor, handle, and temporary-resource leaks -->
**File descriptor, handle, and temporary-resource leaks**
Malformed or canceled work misses cleanup and retains sockets, files, database cursors, timers, subprocesses, temporary files, or object references. Confirm the leak repeats through bounded local iterations and affects a shared pool.

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Universal moves -->
## Universal moves (apply across the above)

- Build an input-to-resource table: earliest accepted size/cardinality, work before auth, downstream fan-out, persistence, shared pool, limit and cleanup owner, recovery.
- Compare aggregate limits with per-object limits. Ten thousand valid one-byte items may evade a per-message cap while exhausting tenant-wide or process-wide state.
- Validate only in an isolated fixture with strict CPU/memory/time limits and small growth points. Mock external and paid calls and stop once the missing bound or cancellation is observable.

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Validation rules -->
## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Name untrusted input, requester work, service amplification or retained resource, shared blast radius, and recovery. Missing limits without concrete shared impact are hardening.
2. Confirm no source-visible upstream, parser, queue, tenant, or framework bound prevents the path. Unknown deployed controls require `needs_validation`.
3. For superlinear behavior, establish the accepted complexity and bounded local growth. For leaks, show repeatable retention after cleanup should occur. For fatal paths, identify process/supervisor isolation.
4. Prioritize by low requester work, unauthenticated reachability, cross-tenant scope, persistence, and poor recovery; do not validate with availability impact.
5. Return `confirmed` only with safe local proof and meaningful shared effect. Return `needs_validation` with the exact upstream limit, topology, quota, or recovery observation an owner must check.

# Execution boundary and paths

- Agent ID `r04`. Write ONLY in `<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/agents/r04/scratch/`. Never edit target files, the ledger, findings, architecture or another agent's directory.
- Run target-controlled code only through `python <WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/tools/sbx.py r04 <cmd...>`: audited source read-only at /target (on PYTHONPATH), scratch at /scratch, no network, no Docker socket, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 1 CPU, 64 pids, 32 MiB files, 120 s. Use `/usr/bin/python3`.
- Unit tests need cwd=/target: `python <WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/tools/sbx.py r04 /usr/bin/sh -c "cd /target && python3 -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider --capture=sys -q tests/test_unit.py"`.
- If you produce a local artifact, list it in a top-level `"artifacts_to_promote": [...]` field (scratch-relative, <=256 KiB each). The parent promotes it after you finish.
- Your final message must be ONLY one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"agentbox/sandbox.py:container-output-readers-without-_Head-byte-cap"}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`. No prose, no code fence.
