You are candidate verifier `v08` in run-4 of a defensive security audit of agentbox. You did not write the candidate below and you did not hunt it.

# Audited source and version

Read-only audited source: `<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/temp/agentbox-run4/src-audited/` — a git worktree of `main` at commit `9805d91` (after refactor PRs #11-#14). Every path and line you cite must exist in THAT tree. The working branch (`docs/security-audit/run-4`) carries audit output only; `/home/user/agentbox` from earlier runs carries later or earlier code and must not be used for line numbers.

 "proposed_verdict": "confirmed",
 "fingerprint": "agentbox/service.py:_call_tool:needs-snapshot-gate-before-gui-lock-lets-burstless-gui-input-after-handback",
 "title": "A GUI input queued on gui_lock across a human handback runs with no burst, so its changes get no snapshot and no gui_changes record for up to 600 s",
 "description": "_call_tool decides whether a GUI input needs a new burst before it acquires gui_lock. While a human holds the desktop a lease exists, so needs_snapshot returns False and the input is queued on gui_lock instead of opening a burst. If the human hands the desktop back inside that gap, the queued input runs with no open burst: it writes files as uid 1001, marks its input time, and from then on needs_snapshot returns False for every later input until the interval expires, so no snapshot, no burst and no gui_changes row are produced. The agent can therefore make a series of unrecorded desktop changes whose only recovery point predates the human takeover.",
 "root_cause": "The burst decision is taken outside the lock that serializes execution: service.py:343 evaluates _needs_snapshot (gui_bursts.py:52-63, False while a lease is present) before _run_tool acquires gui_lock at service.py:136, and the re-check under the lock (_check_control, service.py:152-161) validates only the lease and the pending-takeover marker, never burst presence. _handback_locked (service.py:528-543) releases the lease and calls forget_input inside that lock, so the queued input resumes into a state where its earlier decision premise is gone, and mark_input (service.py:139) then suppresses the next burst decision.",
 "intended_behavior": "Every GUI input that executes must be covered by an open burst bound to a snapshot taken before that input, and each burst must close into a gui_changes record. A decision taken before waiting on a lock must be re-validated after the lock is acquired.",

# agentbox architecture summary (run-4)
Source ref: `9805d91` (`main`, after refactor PRs #11-#14). Profile `standard`, whole repo, budget 50. Built from recon-1a..1d (`agents/recon-*/result.md`). Line numbers below were re-checked by the parent; recon-1b and recon-1c cite some `api.py`, `web.py` and `preview.py` lines that do not exist in this tree, so treat their numbers as approximate.
## 1. Product, principals, protected resources
agentbox is a self-hosted FastAPI + SQLite control plane. It gives AI agents Docker sandboxes, routes risky tool calls through a human approval queue, and keeps a hash-chained audit log. Desktop templates add Xvfb/Xfce/x11vnc/noVNC so a human can watch or take over the screen.
- **Human token** `hum_…` (one shared admin secret, `config.py:88-100`): full JSON API (`api.py:115` `principal`).
- **Browser cookie session**, scope `*` (login form or one-time `*` ticket): full UI. Sessions and tickets carry a `gen` fingerprint of the human token, so rotation revokes them (`desktop.py`).
- **Desktop-link session**, scope = one sandbox id: only that sandbox's desktop page/state/takeover/handback/WS (`api.py:157` `desktop_human`).
- **Agent token** `agt_…` per sandbox (hash stored): tools on its own sandbox, read own sandbox/approval/desktop state. Lowest-trust network principal; the threat model assumes a prompt-injected agent.
- **Code inside the sandbox**: uid 1000 `agent` (exec, file tools) and uid 1001 `desktop` (X session, GUI tools, x11vnc; in the agent group). Every container output (exec stdout, `ps`, `xdotool`, `find -printf` manifest, outbox listing, `ls`, preview `_expand`/`_walk`, screenshot bytes, RFB stream) is attacker data to the control plane.
- **Unauthenticated network clients**: `/`, `/login` (GET/POST; failed POST writes an audit row), `/static/htmx.min.js`, `/static/novnc/*` (`api.py:356`, may create a container via `extract_novnc`), `/healthz`, ticket redemption, FastAPI `/docs`.
- **MCP stdio server / `agent.py` loop**: hold an agent token; trust the local launcher.
Protected resources: the human token and approval authority; host filesystem and Docker daemon (the control plane holds `docker.sock` = host root); other sandboxes; `/workspace` restore points (snapshots before destructive actions and per GUI burst); audit-log integrity and secret masking; control-plane availability (thread pools, memory, SQLite, host disk via `docker commit`).
## 2. Comparable baseline
No source-grounded comparable product. Components: MCP (FastMCP/MCPServer stdio), RFB via x11vnc `-inetd` + socat + noVNC, gVisor/Kata named as preferred runtimes. A runc sandbox shares the host kernel.
## 3. Stack, deployment, offline limits
Python ≥3.11; fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, jinja2, docker SDK, pyyaml, mcp. Modes: `agentbox serve` (127.0.0.1 default; `bind_problem` and `runtime_problem` gates, `cli.py:68-111`; `runtime_problem` rejects only the literal `"runc"`), compose + Caddy with `--behind-tls-proxy` and `forwarded_allow_ips="*"` by default (`cli.py:124-126`), and the bare `create_app` factory (`api.py:376`) that skips the serve-time gates. Container flags (`sandbox.py:243-265`): `network_mode=none`, non-recursive read-only `/source` bind, `cap_drop ALL` + CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER/SETUID/SETGID, no-new-privileges, mem/cpu/pids limits, no userns, default seccomp. The desktop start script resets `/home/desktop` on every start and restore (v19 fix).
Host for this run: Docker 29.9.1, runtimes `runc`/`io.containerd.runc.v2` only, cgroup v1, images `ubuntu:24.04`, `buildpack-deps:noble-curl`, `agentbox-desktop:0.1` (rebuilt from this tree). Agent-run code goes through `tools/sbx` (no network, read-only target, 256 MiB loop scratch, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 64 pids, 120 s; `agentbox.web`/`api` importable). Docker-free tests: `tests/test_unit.py`, `test_m2_unit.py`, `test_m4_unit.py`; fakes for `GuiBursts`/`AgentBox` in `test_m2_unit.py`. Anything needing the real daemon is a parent-live check.
## 4. Entry surfaces and important paths
- **Tools**: `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/tools/{tool}` → `AgentBox.call_tool` (`service.py:268`, per-sandbox concurrency 4, `_snap_locks`) → `_call_tool` (`service.py:290`: audit with capped args `_logged_args:181` → `policy.decide` → quota → approval or `_snapshot:250` → `_run_tool`) on the 32-thread `tool_pool` (`api.py:103`). Pending approvals capped at 20 (`service.py:44`).
- **Approvals**: `POST /approvals/{aid}` / `POST /ui/approvals/...` (human) → `decide` (`service.py:389`): atomic claim, snapshot, run stored args. Runs on the Starlette threadpool, outside `tool_pool`, `_busy` and `_snap_locks`. Preview (`preview.py:67` `preview_command` with `_expand`/`_walk` callbacks, `sandbox.py:557-569`) and capture run before the approval exists.
- **Lifecycle** (refactor PR 1): `pause_sandbox/resume_sandbox/snapshot_sandbox/restore_sandbox/delete_sandbox` (`service.py:444-475`), called by `api.py` and `web.py` inside `guard`. Restore: log → `end_desktop` → `sandboxes.restore` → `bursts.reset_timers` → log. Delete: log → `end_desktop` → delete → `drop_captures`. Pause: log → `bursts.end` → pause. None takes `gui_lock` or `_snap_locks`.
- **GUI bursts** (`gui_bursts.py:23`, refactor PR 2): `needs_snapshot:52`, `open:65` (fail-closed baseline, bound to `container_id`), `close:100`/`_finish:113` (stray kill via `gui_state.gui_strays` from root `ps` + `_NET_WM_PID`, manifest diff → `gui_changes`), `close_idle:137` on a dedicated pool from `expire_stale` callers, `end:157`. Timestamps `_gui_input_at`/`_gui_snap_at` are written without a lock.
- **Desktop**: tickets (60 s, one-time, hashed), sessions (12 h, scoped), leases; takeover/handback (`service.py:503,523`, `bursts.close` under `gui_lock`); WS route `api.py:344` (cookie, `same_origin` with missing Origin allowed, mode, `may_connect`) → `desktop_ws.relay:18` (no auth of its own; session re-check every 30 s; x11vnc without `-noremote`/`-safer`).
- **Files**: `read_file`/`write_file`/`delete_file`/`list_dir` (`safe_path`), upload, outbox list/read; `list_dir`, `exists`, `is_dir`, `outbox_list`, `_expand` run `exec_run` with no container-side timeout and full buffering.
- **Rendering**: Jinja autoescape + `finalize=_shown` → `display.escape_controls:18` (shared with `cli._safe`); `_NoFraming` middleware (`api.py:63`) on HTTP responses.
- **Audit**: hash chain + append-only triggers, `mask_text`; `log_human` fails closed with 503 (`service.py:590`); tool results and burst records are best-effort.
## 5. Trust boundaries and strongest control
| Boundary | Strongest control |
|---|---|
| Agent → host/other sandboxes | container hardening + runtime (runc on this host) |
| Agent → approval gate (exec) | `policy.simple_programs` allowlist + `has_bash_comment` + `>`/`$` gate |
| Agent → approval gate (GUI) | none by design; burst snapshot, fail-closed open, `gui_changes`, stray kill (N-1 partial) |
| Agent → human authority | token kinds, `human_only`, scope checks, `samefile` source_dir overlap check |
| Agent → control-plane availability | `tool_pool`, tool concurrency, `_Head`, snapshot quota, pending cap, `_timed` X/manifest execs |
| Container output → control plane | `_parse_ps`, `_parse_manifest`, `_parse_outbox`, preview parsing; masking; escaping |
| Browser → UI | SameSite=Strict HttpOnly cookie, `same_origin`, XFO/frame-ancestors |
| Desktop-link session → rest of UI | `scope`, `desktop_human` |
| Network → control plane | `bind_problem`; proxy trust `*`; unauthenticated login/novnc routes |
## 6. Starting paths
`agentbox/service.py`, `gui_bursts.py`, `gui_state.py`, `sandbox.py`, `sandbox_desktop.py`, `sandbox_common.py`, `preview.py`, `api.py`, `desktop_ws.py`, `web.py`, `display.py`, `desktop.py`, `policy.py`, `audit.py`, `approvals.py`, `cli.py`, `config.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `agent.py`, `default_policy.yaml`, `templates/`, `images/desktop/`, `deploy/`.
## 7. Prior coverage and revalidation
Prior ledgers: run-1 (`7fc501f`) and run-3 (`0e4b958`/`8e4db9e`, incomplete, 29 units); run-2 validated run-1 live. Every run-3 confirmed record (11) was fixed and the refactor moved the code, so all are `prior_confirmed_changed_source` revalidation units, not hunter exclusions. Five run-3 `needs_validation` records (v01 same_origin scheme, v09 burst open, v10 gui_lock, v14 framing, v15 `gui_strays` window ownership) are current work. Three critic-3 units deferred in run-3 (GUI-burst state races, disk/SQLite pressure, pre-auth work) are current work. Two rejected claims (runc alias, backgrounded-children pid exhaustion) suppress only those exact claims. No same-source confirmed exclusions. Recon-flagged seams: lifecycle methods without `gui_lock`/`_snap_locks`, `decide` outside the snapshot lock, synchronous burst closes on human threads, unbounded/untimed preview and listing execs, error/preview strings that bypass the audit arg cap, unauthenticated audit growth, x11vnc remote-control plus `from_exec` stray exemption, root `/tmp` operations in the desktop start script.
## 8. Companion selection
- `RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md`: agent work consumes shared pools, memory, SQLite and host disk.
- `AI-AND-LLM.md`: tool-calling agent behind an approval gate; MCP server; prompt-injection threat model.
- `WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md`: cookie sessions, tickets, login, proxy headers.
- `CLIENT-SIDE.md`: htmx UI and a cookie-authenticated WebSocket.
- `DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md`: x11vnc/docker-exec bridge, uid 1001 helper inspected and killed by the control plane.
- `CLOUD-AND-DEPLOYMENT.md`: container capabilities, runtime selection, compose/proxy precedence.
- `DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md`: snapshots/restore, delete, audit as alternate reader, lifecycle consolidation.
- Excluded: `MEMORY-SAFETY-AND-BINARY.md` (no native code in scope), `SUPPLY-CHAIN-AND-RELEASE.md` (no release or signing path; CI runs tests with read-only contents), `PROTOCOLS-RPC-AND-MESSAGING.md` (no broker or RPC beyond HTTP/WS/MCP stdio covered elsewhere).

# Relevant companion blocks (verbatim)

<!-- DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md#Core discipline -->
## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Establish the realistic local or remote-content attacker: another app, another OS user, a sandboxed child, an untrusted document, or a remote origin. Self-harm within the same account and authority is not a boundary violation.
- Paths, process names, bundle/package IDs, and claimed sender fields are not peer authentication. Use OS peer credentials, code identity, capability handles, or protected channel state.
- The native bridge or helper must authorize each operation and final resource after parsing. A trusted UI or broker does not make attacker-influenceable arguments trusted.
- OS sandbox, signing, entitlements, permissions, keychain ACLs, exported-component policy, and prompt behavior are real controls when pinned and visible.
- Use `confirmed` for source evidence plus bounded local/emulator tests. Use `needs_validation` when signing, manifest merge, OS version, device policy, installer ACL, or packaging is required but not observable.
```

<!-- DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md#Local file ownership and TOCTOU -->
**Local file ownership and TOCTOU**
The app checks a file/path then follows replacement, symlink, mount, or case/normalization changes during a privileged read/write. Use descriptor-relative operations and verify final ownership. Focus `MEMORY-SAFETY-AND-BINARY.md` on parsing after the file is opened.

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Reachable fatal error or deadlock -->
**Reachable fatal error or deadlock**
An untrusted input reaches `panic`, abort, fatal assertion, unhandled exception, process exit, lock cycle, or infinite loop in a shared process. Confirm supervisor scope and whether one worker or the whole service becomes unavailable. A restarted isolated worker may reduce impact but does not erase the defect.

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Unsafe recovery and capacity rollback -->
**Unsafe recovery and capacity rollback**
A restart, restore, fallback, or cleanup path rebuilds unbounded state, ignores current quotas, or restores the input that immediately repeats failure. Recovery correctness is part of availability.

<!-- DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md#Universal moves -->
## Universal moves (apply across the above)

- Enumerate every process, app component, local endpoint, URI scheme, file association, webview origin, and helper. Record OS identity, runtime privilege, caller, and callable operation.
- Read final packaging inputs: merged manifest, entitlements, installer rules, native-messaging registration, protocol handlers, and ACL creation. Source declarations can be overwritten downstream.
- Validate with dummy profiles and non-sensitive local fixtures on an isolated machine/emulator. Do not interact with other users' apps, credentials, or production services.

<!-- DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md#Validation rules -->
## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Name the attacker starting capability, OS/app principal crossed, entry channel, accepted argument or state, and unauthorized operation or disclosure.
2. Confirm OS sandbox, peer credential, signing, entitlement, permission, user-consent, and installer controls that apply. Unknown packaging/runtime facts require `needs_validation`.
3. For webview bridges, cite both navigation/origin control and privileged native sink. For IPC, cite peer authentication and per-resource authorization. For helpers, verify final normalized destination.
4. Keep local tests bounded and use dummy content/accounts. Stop after proving the boundary result; do not extend proof into persistence or broader system modification.
5. Return `confirmed` only with a complete source and local evidence chain. Return `needs_validation` with the exact OS, manifest, signing, ACL, or device-lifecycle fact required.

# Verifier instructions (verbatim)

```text
You did not write this candidate. Try to refute it from repository source and bounded
local evidence. Do not contact deployed endpoints or external/shared services. Run
target-controlled code only inside the approved OS-enforced sandbox: no external
network, empty allowlisted environment, read-only target and tools, scratch-only
writes, and explicit low resource and wall-clock limits. If any control is unavailable,
do not execute; retain the exact missing capability as a needs_validation blocker.
Treat every scratch entry as target-controlled after execution. After the sandbox and
all its processes terminate, only trusted parent-side code may promote a predeclared
scratch-relative file, following the promotion procedure block included verbatim in
this prompt. You and target code never write retained artifacts. If promotion is
unavailable or fails, do not use that file as evidence.

1. Verify every trace and evidence file, positive line number, scope, and description.
   Confirm the first entry is a real lower-trust entrypoint and the last is the
   claimed sink or boundary effect.
2. Reconstruct the strongest source-visible validation, identity, authorization,
   normalization, lifecycle, framework, and containment controls on the path.
   Where the architecture summary names a comparable baseline, note whether it
   shares the pattern — as calibration, never as grounds to dismiss.
3. For a proposed confirmed candidate, independently reproduce the minimum observed
   result when possible. Verify inputs, interface shape, conditions, and affected
   dummy principal/resource. Do not infer a stronger result or continue after it.
4. Verify that likelihood, impact, confidence, and the proposed source fix match only
   what the evidence establishes.
5. For a proposed needs_validation candidate, decide whether the blocker is genuinely
   outside source/local observation. If source refutes the trace, reject it. If the
   missing fact remains decisive, keep needs_validation and make the local and
   owner-observed plans exact and non-destructive.
6. Preserve the fingerprint for the same source-derived root cause across every state.

Return exactly one JSON object and no surrounding prose:
{"decision": "confirmed|needs_validation|rejected", "record": { ... }}
where record exactly matches the decision's verdict branch of the schema included
in this prompt. A corrected record replaces the hunter's wording.
```

# Artifact promotion procedure (verbatim)

```text
Artifact promotion procedure (trusted parent-side code only):
Reference only for you: the parent performs these steps; you never perform them.

Before execution, the parent opens and retains trusted, non-inheritable directory
descriptors for the agent's scratch/ and artifacts/ roots, and records an allowlist
of expected scratch-relative artifact files plus explicit per-file and cumulative
byte limits. Never pass those descriptors to the agent or sandbox. After the sandbox
and all its processes terminate, trusted parent-side code promotes each allowlisted
file separately:

1. Validate the declared relative path: reject absolute, empty, `.`, `..`, or
   symlinked components.
2. Walk each parent component from the retained scratch-root descriptor with
   no-follow directory-relative operations; never reopen by path.
3. Open the leaf no-follow and nonblocking.
4. Verify with `fstat` that it is a regular file with link count exactly one and
   within the recorded per-file and cumulative byte limits.
5. Enforce those limits again while reading from that descriptor.
6. Copy exactly the verified size, repeat `fstat`, and reject a changed identity,
   type, link count, or size.
7. For the destination, walk every parent component from the retained
   artifacts-root descriptor with no-follow directory-relative operations; require
   each existing component to be a real directory, and create any missing directory
   exclusively before reopening and verifying it no-follow.
8. Create the leaf exclusively without following links, verify that the opened
   destination is a regular file with link count exactly one, and copy from the
   verified source descriptor without reopening either path.
9. Use equivalent race-safe APIs on non-POSIX systems.
10. Never recursively copy or glob scratch, extract an archive into artifacts, or
    open or promote a symlink, FIFO, socket, device, directory, hard-linked file,
    changing file, or file that exceeds its bound.
11. If any check is unavailable, cannot be enforced, or fails, discard the scratch
    entry; if it is decisive evidence, retain `needs_validation` with the exact
    promotion blocker.
```

# Execution boundary and paths

- Agent ID `v08`. Write ONLY in `<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/agents/v08/scratch/`. Never edit target files, the ledger, findings, architecture or another agent's directory.
- Run target-controlled code only through `python <WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/tools/sbx.py v08 <cmd...>`. Inside: the audited source is /target (read-only, on PYTHONPATH), your scratch is /scratch (cwd, writable), there is no network and no Docker socket, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 1 CPU, 64 pids, 32 MiB files, 120 s wall clock, empty allowlisted environment. Use `/usr/bin/python3` (Python 3.12; fastapi, docker SDK, jinja2, pyyaml, mcp, pyte importable).
- Unit tests need cwd=/target: `python <WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/tools/sbx.py v08 /usr/bin/sh -c "cd /target && python3 -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider --capture=sys -q tests/test_unit.py"`.
- A fact that needs the real Docker-backed control plane, the desktop image at runtime, or a deployment the audit does not own stays a `needs_validation` blocker with an exact plan. Do not contact deployed endpoints.
- If you produce a local artifact, list it in a top-level `"artifacts_to_promote": [...]` field beside `decision` and `record` (scratch-relative, <=256 KiB each, 1 MiB total). The parent promotes it after you finish.
- Your final message must be ONLY the JSON object `{"decision": ..., "record": {...}}` plus that optional field. No prose, no code fence.
