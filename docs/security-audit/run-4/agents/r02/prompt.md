You are final record verifier `r02` in run-4 of a defensive security audit of agentbox. You did not hunt this candidate and you did not perform its Phase 3 validation. You check the STRUCTURED RECORD below, not anyone's write-up.

# Audited source and version

Read-only audited source: `<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/temp/agentbox-run4/src-audited/` — a git worktree of `main` at commit `9805d91`. Every path and line must exist in THAT tree. `/home/user/agentbox` from earlier runs carries different code and must not be used for line numbers.

 "fingerprint": "agentbox/api.py:same_origin:scheme-blind-origin-netloc-compare",
 "title": "same_origin compares only the Origin netloc with Host, so an http:// page on the same host passes the CSRF origin check of a TLS deployment and can clear the session cookie",
 "description": "Every cookie-authenticated UI mutation funnels through api.same_origin (api.py:131-133), which returns True when Origin is absent or when urlsplit(Origin).netloc equals the Host header; the scheme is never compared. A plaintext http://H page is a different web origin from the TLS deployment https://H but carries the same netloc, so the gate accepts it. Independently reproduced (agents/v02/scratch/v02_origin.py, artifact v02_origin.out; api.build with docker.from_env stubbed, ASGI served as https://agentbox.example): Origin http://agentbox.example was accepted for POST /login (303, issuing the Secure SameSite=strict HttpOnly host-only session cookie), POST /ui/approvals/apr_000000000000/approve (200; box.decide entered with the '*' session and rendered approval-not-found), POST /ui/sandboxes (handler reached box.create_sandbox) and POST /logout (303; end_ui_session entered, server session ended - a later GET /ui with the same cookie redirected to /login). Origin https://agentbox.example was accepted identically; Origin https://evil.example, Origin: null, Origin http://agentbox.example@evil.example and Origin http://agentbox.example:8443 against Host agentbox.example were all 403; a POST with no Origin was accepted. Consequence (1): where a browser attaches the Strict cookie to a cross-scheme POST, the human-scoped action runs - approve/deny for a known apr_ id, a sandbox built for an attacker-chosen source_dir, or server-side session end. Consequence (2), browser-independent once the request is sent: POST /logout answers even a cookieless cross-origin request with 303 plus an unconditional cookie-clearing Set-Cookie (web.py:149-150), so a page served at http://H forces a client-side logout while the server-side session survives. No anti-CSRF token, Referer or Sec-Fetch check exists anywhere in agentbox/ (grep finds none) and the only response-wide guard is X-Object-Frame/CSP frame-ancestors (api.py:66), which stops iframe clickjacking but not a top-level auto-submitted form; no Strict-Transport-Security is emitted in agentbox/ or deploy/ (no response carries one; only audit docs mention it), so nothing forces the upgrade of http://H. The decisive unknown stays the browser's schemeful same-site behaviour: the run-3 loopback Chromium 141 run had the Secure cookie withheld (only the forced browser logout occurred), no browser exists in sbx, and Firefox/WebKit are unobserved, so whether consequence (1) is reachable cannot be decided from source or from this sandbox.",
 "claimed_root_cause": "api.py:131-133: same_origin() returns True when urlsplit(origin).netloc == headers.get('host') (and when Origin is absent); the scheme is never compared, and the closure receives only headers (api.py:131) although the app derives the request scheme elsewhere (api.py:136, web.py:114). Nothing in agentbox/ or deploy/ emits Strict-Transport-Security (deploy/Caddyfile:5 is a bare reverse_proxy), so the CSRF gate degrades to whatever same-site semantics the browser applies to http://H versus https://H.",

If HSTS is present and every browser is schemeful, only the browser-independent forced-logout residual from the unconditional delete_cookie at web.py:149-150 remains, and the same scheme comparison removes it."

# Phase 5 procedure (verbatim)

```text
### Phase 5: Verify the final records with fresh eyes

Launch one fresh `research` verifier per final `confirmed` and `needs_validation` record, in parallel. This verifier checks the structured record, not the hunter write-up, and remains inside source/local boundaries.

In a `quick` run, Phase 3 and Phase 5 merge: the Phase 3 verifier also performs these record checks and returns the final schema-shaped record, so each candidate gets one fresh independent reviewer instead of two. Every other profile keeps the two passes separate. Never skip independent review of a `confirmed` record in any profile.

For `confirmed`, require it to check:

1. Every repository-relative trace/evidence path, line, scope, and described operation.
2. Real entry interface and exact local input shape.
3. Every condition, parser/policy step, source-visible preventing layer, and observed local result.
4. Affected principal/resource and demonstrated impact.
5. Severity separation: realistic likelihood, demonstrated impact, overall no greater than impact.
6. Remediation strategy and any `code_changes`, including whether the fix enforces the invariant without merely moving trust.

For `needs_validation`, require it to check:

1. The source path is real and supports only the `claimed_root_cause` stated.
2. Every listed blocker is decisive and not already answerable locally.
3. The candidate names a boundary and a possible concrete result rather than a generic concern.
4. At least one validation-plan field is present and exact. `local` uses a bounded fixture; `deployment` asks an owner to observe a configuration, identity, route, policy, or runtime fact. Do not invent a plan for an inapplicable context, and never send audit traffic to a deployment.
5. The fingerprint matches prior/current records for the same root cause.

Each verifier returns exactly one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"..."}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`, with no surrounding prose. A replacement record must match its `confirmed`, `needs_validation`, or `rejected` schema branch. Treat a malformed or prose-wrapped Phase 5 result the same way as in Phase 3: discard it without repairing it and re-run with a fresh verifier when the budget permits.

Do not apply a Phase 5 replacement as final when it promotes a record to a stronger verdict, including any promotion to `confirmed`, or materially changes the root cause, trace, execution input or observed result, demonstrated impact, or severity. Give that complete replacement to a new independent verifier that did not hunt, perform Phase 3 validation, or propose the Phase 5 replacement. The new verifier rechecks the current source and independently reproduces any decisive local result under the execution boundary, then returns `verified` or another replacement. Apply a material replacement only after this fresh verification. If another material replacement results, repeat with a fresh verifier. If budget or independence is unavailable, remove the disputed record from `findings.json`, keep its ledger unit as an unresolved candidate, and set `run_status: "incomplete"` with an exact `incomplete_reason`. Non-material wording or repository-line corrections may be applied directly when they do not change meaning or evidence.

After every applied replacement, rerun both validators and update linked ledger decisions. If a final verifier identifies a separate root cause, assign a new fingerprint and send it through independent candidate validation before inclusion. Set `run_status: "complete"` only when every ledger candidate has an independent final disposition and every retained record passes Phase 5.

Do not verify only `confirmed` records. A misleading `needs_validation` handoff wastes owner time and can preserve a false premise.

# Architecture facts (summary; re-check every line you rely on)

# agentbox architecture summary (run-4)

Source ref: `9805d91` (`main`, after refactor PRs #11-#14). Profile `standard`, whole repo, budget 50. Built from recon-1a..1d (`agents/recon-*/result.md`). Line numbers below were re-checked by the parent; recon-1b and recon-1c cite some `api.py`, `web.py` and `preview.py` lines that do not exist in this tree, so treat their numbers as approximate.

## 1. Product, principals, protected resources

agentbox is a self-hosted FastAPI + SQLite control plane. It gives AI agents Docker sandboxes, routes risky tool calls through a human approval queue, and keeps a hash-chained audit log. Desktop templates add Xvfb/Xfce/x11vnc/noVNC so a human can watch or take over the screen.

- **Human token** `hum_…` (one shared admin secret, `config.py:88-100`): full JSON API (`api.py:115` `principal`).
- **Browser cookie session**, scope `*` (login form or one-time `*` ticket): full UI. Sessions and tickets carry a `gen` fingerprint of the human token, so rotation revokes them (`desktop.py`).
- **Desktop-link session**, scope = one sandbox id: only that sandbox's desktop page/state/takeover/handback/WS (`api.py:157` `desktop_human`).
- **Agent token** `agt_…` per sandbox (hash stored): tools on its own sandbox, read own sandbox/approval/desktop state. Lowest-trust network principal; the threat model assumes a prompt-injected agent.
- **Code inside the sandbox**: uid 1000 `agent` (exec, file tools) and uid 1001 `desktop` (X session, GUI tools, x11vnc; in the agent group). Every container output (exec stdout, `ps`, `xdotool`, `find -printf` manifest, outbox listing, `ls`, preview `_expand`/`_walk`, screenshot bytes, RFB stream) is attacker data to the control plane.
- **Unauthenticated network clients**: `/`, `/login` (GET/POST; failed POST writes an audit row), `/static/htmx.min.js`, `/static/novnc/*` (`api.py:356`, may create a container via `extract_novnc`), `/healthz`, ticket redemption, FastAPI `/docs`.
- **MCP stdio server / `agent.py` loop**: hold an agent token; trust the local launcher.

Protected resources: the human token and approval authority; host filesystem and Docker daemon (the control plane holds `docker.sock` = host root); other sandboxes; `/workspace` restore points (snapshots before destructive actions and per GUI burst); audit-log integrity and secret masking; control-plane availability (thread pools, memory, SQLite, host disk via `docker commit`).

## 2. Comparable baseline

No source-grounded comparable product. Components: MCP (FastMCP/MCPServer stdio), RFB via x11vnc `-inetd` + socat + noVNC, gVisor/Kata named as preferred runtimes. A runc sandbox shares the host kernel.

## 3. Stack, deployment, offline limits

Python ≥3.11; fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, jinja2, docker SDK, pyyaml, mcp. Modes: `agentbox serve` (127.0.0.1 default; `bind_problem` and `runtime_problem` gates, `cli.py:68-111`; `runtime_problem` rejects only the literal `"runc"`), compose + Caddy with `--behind-tls-proxy` and `forwarded_allow_ips="*"` by default (`cli.py:124-126`), and the bare `create_app` factory (`api.py:376`) that skips the serve-time gates. Container flags (`sandbox.py:243-265`): `network_mode=none`, non-recursive read-only `/source` bind, `cap_drop ALL` + CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER/SETUID/SETGID, no-new-privileges, mem/cpu/pids limits, no userns, default seccomp. The desktop start script resets `/home/desktop` on every start and restore (v19 fix).

Host for this run: Docker 29.9.1, runtimes `runc`/`io.containerd.runc.v2` only, cgroup v1, images `ubuntu:24.04`, `buildpack-deps:noble-curl`, `agentbox-desktop:0.1` (rebuilt from this tree). Agent-run code goes through `tools/sbx` (no network, read-only target, 256 MiB loop scratch, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 64 pids, 120 s; `agentbox.web`/`api` importable). Docker-free tests: `tests/test_unit.py`, `test_m2_unit.py`, `test_m4_unit.py`; fakes for `GuiBursts`/`AgentBox` in `test_m2_unit.py`. Anything needing the real daemon is a parent-live check.

## 4. Entry surfaces and important paths

- **Tools**: `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/tools/{tool}` → `AgentBox.call_tool` (`service.py:268`, per-sandbox concurrency 4, `_snap_locks`) → `_call_tool` (`service.py:290`: audit with capped args `_logged_args:181` → `policy.decide` → quota → approval or `_snapshot:250` → `_run_tool`) on the 32-thread `tool_pool` (`api.py:103`). Pending approvals capped at 20 (`service.py:44`).
- **Approvals**: `POST /approvals/{aid}` / `POST /ui/approvals/...` (human) → `decide` (`service.py:389`): atomic claim, snapshot, run stored args. Runs on the Starlette threadpool, outside `tool_pool`, `_busy` and `_snap_locks`. Preview (`preview.py:67` `preview_command` with `_expand`/`_walk` callbacks, `sandbox.py:557-569`) and capture run before the approval exists.
- **Lifecycle** (refactor PR 1): `pause_sandbox/resume_sandbox/snapshot_sandbox/restore_sandbox/delete_sandbox` (`service.py:444-475`), called by `api.py` and `web.py` inside `guard`. Restore: log → `end_desktop` → `sandboxes.restore` → `bursts.reset_timers` → log. Delete: log → `end_desktop` → delete → `drop_captures`. Pause: log → `bursts.end` → pause. None takes `gui_lock` or `_snap_locks`.
- **GUI bursts** (`gui_bursts.py:23`, refactor PR 2): `needs_snapshot:52`, `open:65` (fail-closed baseline, bound to `container_id`), `close:100`/`_finish:113` (stray kill via `gui_state.gui_strays` from root `ps` + `_NET_WM_PID`, manifest diff → `gui_changes`), `close_idle:137` on a dedicated pool from `expire_stale` callers, `end:157`. Timestamps `_gui_input_at`/`_gui_snap_at` are written without a lock.
- **Desktop**: tickets (60 s, one-time, hashed), sessions (12 h, scoped), leases; takeover/handback (`service.py:503,523`, `bursts.close` under `gui_lock`); WS route `api.py:344` (cookie, `same_origin` with missing Origin allowed, mode, `may_connect`) → `desktop_ws.relay:18` (no auth of its own; session re-check every 30 s; x11vnc without `-noremote`/`-safer`).
- **Files**: `read_file`/`write_file`/`delete_file`/`list_dir` (`safe_path`), upload, outbox list/read; `list_dir`, `exists`, `is_dir`, `outbox_list`, `_expand` run `exec_run` with no container-side timeout and full buffering.
- **Rendering**: Jinja autoescape + `finalize=_shown` → `display.escape_controls:18` (shared with `cli._safe`); `_NoFraming` middleware (`api.py:63`) on HTTP responses.
- **Audit**: hash chain + append-only triggers, `mask_text`; `log_human` fails closed with 503 (`service.py:590`); tool results and burst records are best-effort.

## 5. Trust boundaries and strongest control

| Boundary | Strongest control |
|---|---|
| Agent → host/other sandboxes | container hardening + runtime (runc on this host) |
| Agent → approval gate (exec) | `policy.simple_programs` allowlist + `has_bash_comment` + `>`/`$` gate |
| Agent → approval gate (GUI) | none by design; burst snapshot, fail-closed open, `gui_changes`, stray kill (N-1 partial) |
| Agent → human authority | token kinds, `human_only`, scope checks, `samefile` source_dir overlap check |
| Agent → control-plane availability | `tool_pool`, tool concurrency, `_Head`, snapshot quota, pending cap, `_timed` X/manifest execs |
| Container output → control plane | `_parse_ps`, `_parse_manifest`, `_parse_outbox`, preview parsing; masking; escaping |
| Browser → UI | SameSite=Strict HttpOnly cookie, `same_origin`, XFO/frame-ancestors |
| Desktop-link session → rest of UI | `scope`, `desktop_human` |
| Network → control plane | `bind_problem`; proxy trust `*`; unauthenticated login/novnc routes |

## 6. Starting paths

`agentbox/service.py`, `gui_bursts.py`, `gui_state.py`, `sandbox.py`, `sandbox_desktop.py`, `sandbox_common.py`, `preview.py`, `api.py`, `desktop_ws.py`, `web.py`, `display.py`, `desktop.py`, `policy.py`, `audit.py`, `approvals.py`, `cli.py`, `config.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `agent.py`, `default_policy.yaml`, `templates/`, `images/desktop/`, `deploy/`.

## 7. Prior coverage and revalidation

Prior ledgers: run-1 (`7fc501f`) and run-3 (`0e4b958`/`8e4db9e`, incomplete, 29 units); run-2 validated run-1 live. Every run-3 confirmed record (11) was fixed and the refactor moved the code, so all are `prior_confirmed_changed_source` revalidation units, not hunter exclusions. Five run-3 `needs_validation` records (v01 same_origin scheme, v09 burst open, v10 gui_lock, v14 framing, v15 `gui_strays` window ownership) are current work. Three critic-3 units deferred in run-3 (GUI-burst state races, disk/SQLite pressure, pre-auth work) are current work. Two rejected claims (runc alias, backgrounded-children pid exhaustion) suppress only those exact claims. No same-source confirmed exclusions. Recon-flagged seams: lifecycle methods without `gui_lock`/`_snap_locks`, `decide` outside the snapshot lock, synchronous burst closes on human threads, unbounded/untimed preview and listing execs, error/preview strings that bypass the audit arg cap, unauthenticated audit growth, x11vnc remote-control plus `from_exec` stray exemption, root `/tmp` operations in the desktop start script.

## 8. Companion selection

- `RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md`: agent work consumes shared pools, memory, SQLite and host disk.
- `AI-AND-LLM.md`: tool-calling agent behind an approval gate; MCP server; prompt-injection threat model.
- `WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md`: cookie sessions, tickets, login, proxy headers.
- `CLIENT-SIDE.md`: htmx UI and a cookie-authenticated WebSocket.
- `DESKTOP-MOBILE-AND-LOCAL-IPC.md`: x11vnc/docker-exec bridge, uid 1001 helper inspected and killed by the control plane.
- `CLOUD-AND-DEPLOYMENT.md`: container capabilities, runtime selection, compose/proxy precedence.
- `DATA-ISOLATION-AND-LIFECYCLE.md`: snapshots/restore, delete, audit as alternate reader, lifecycle consolidation.
- Excluded: `MEMORY-SAFETY-AND-BINARY.md` (no native code in scope), `SUPPLY-CHAIN-AND-RELEASE.md` (no release or signing path; CI runs tests with read-only contents), `PROTOCOLS-RPC-AND-MESSAGING.md` (no broker or RPC beyond HTTP/WS/MCP stdio covered elsewhere).

# Relevant companion blocks (verbatim)

<!-- WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md#Core discipline -->
## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Framing and cache findings require two interpretations of the same request, response, or key. Name both components and the exact normalized value on each side.
- For every credential, find the signature or secret verification and every binding required for its role: issuer, audience, origin, RP, client, session, principal, resource, assurance, expiry, and one-time state.
- Host, Forwarded, X-Forwarded-*, Origin, Referer, redirect targets, callback state, and request-derived URLs are trust decisions. Trace each to the affected identity or response.
- A missing header, cookie attribute, MFA prompt, or rate limit is not a finding alone. Require an accepted invalid request, cross-principal impact, assurance downgrade, or credential disclosure.
- Classify `confirmed` only from complete source evidence and bounded local request/token tests. Use `needs_validation` when proxy, IdP, browser, certificate, secret, or deployed configuration is required but not visible.
```

<!-- WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md#Ordinary CSRF -->
**Ordinary CSRF**
A browser sends ambient credentials to a state-changing endpoint that accepts a cross-site request without an effective anti-CSRF token, same-site request binding, or strict Origin/Referer validation. Inventory every cookie-authenticated mutation, including form, JSON-like, multipart, method-override, and legacy routes. SameSite is effective only for the cookie and browser contexts actually used; login CSRF and cross-site subresource requests can have different requirements.

<!-- WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md#Host and forwarded-header trust -->
**Host and forwarded-header trust**
Untrusted host/proxy metadata determines absolute URLs, tenant routing, callbacks, reset links, cache keys, or the client address used by authorization. Confirm who can supply the header and whether trusted ingress removes client-provided copies.

<!-- WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md#Universal moves -->
## Universal moves (apply across the above)

- Walk issue → store → transmit → consume → refresh → revoke for every credential and challenge. Compare normal, error, retry, migration, legacy, and account-switch paths.
- Enumerate every door to the same identity and every route to the same sensitive operation. The effective policy is the weakest parallel path, not the most polished UI.
- Diff parser, proxy, router, cache, and application normalization side by side. For local validation, feed identical bounded request fixtures into each component rather than sending traffic to a live deployment.
- For recovery and linking, draw the account before/after graph. Each edge must name the current principal, proof of the new identity, required assurance, callback/session binding, and revocation effect.

<!-- WEB-PROTOCOL-AND-AUTH.md#Validation rules -->
## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Apply a source-visibility gate. Proxy chains, edge cache keys, IdP policy, certificate trust, browser cookie behavior, secrets, and deployed auth modes may be outside the repository. Record a precise `needs_validation` candidate instead of asserting missing infrastructure behavior.
2. For framing and cache findings, name both components and the divergent parse/key. Confirm cross-request, cross-user, or private-response impact with bounded local fixtures.
3. For token, MFA, passkey, account-link, recovery, API-key, and mTLS findings, cite the verification line and missing principal/session/resource/origin/audience/action/assurance binding. Prove the server accepts the invalid transition or credential.
4. For CSRF, name the ambient credential, state-changing route, accepted cross-site request shape, browser cookie policy, and missing effective check. Read-only actions and routes requiring a non-ambient bearer token do not qualify.
5. Verify framework and library defaults. If version or configuration is unknown, use `needs_validation`; do not turn an unverified critical claim into a lower-severity confirmed finding.
6. Return `confirmed` only with a complete source trace and observable unauthorized identity, state, or disclosure. For `needs_validation`, name the missing fact and safe local or owner-observed check that resolves it.

# Execution boundary and paths

- Agent ID `r02`. Write ONLY in `<WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/agents/r02/scratch/`. Never edit target files, the ledger, findings, architecture or another agent's directory.
- Run target-controlled code only through `python <WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/tools/sbx.py r02 <cmd...>`: audited source read-only at /target (on PYTHONPATH), scratch at /scratch, no network, no Docker socket, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 1 CPU, 64 pids, 32 MiB files, 120 s. Use `/usr/bin/python3`.
- Unit tests need cwd=/target: `python <WINDOWS_HOST_ROOT>/projects/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/tools/sbx.py r02 /usr/bin/sh -c "cd /target && python3 -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider --capture=sys -q tests/test_unit.py"`.
- If you produce a local artifact, list it in a top-level `"artifacts_to_promote": [...]` field (scratch-relative, <=256 KiB each). The parent promotes it after you finish.
- Your final message must be ONLY one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"agentbox/api.py:same_origin:scheme-blind-origin-netloc-compare"}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`. No prose, no code fence.
