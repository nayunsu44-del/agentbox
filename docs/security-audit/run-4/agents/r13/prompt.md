You are final record verifier `r13` in run-4 of a defensive security audit of agentbox. You did not hunt this candidate and you did not perform its Phase 3 validation. You check the STRUCTURED RECORD below, not anyone's write-up.

# Audited source and version

Read-only audited source: `/tmp/claude-0/-home-user-agentbox/fcd2f048-3e17-52e2-9d78-d39b755653f3/scratchpad/src-audited/` — a git worktree of `main` at commit `9805d91`. Every path and line must exist in THAT tree. `/home/user/agentbox` from earlier runs carries different code and must not be used for line numbers.

# Record under verification

{
 "verdict": "needs_validation",
 "fingerprint": "agentbox/service.py:snapshot-quota:toctou-between-quota-gate-and-pre-exec-snapshot",
 "title": "Snapshot quota is decided from one container probe, but the docker commit is triggered by a second probe that the quota does not check",
 "description": "An agent that holds only its own sandbox's agent token can get docker commits without approval after its sandbox has reached snapshot_quota (default 50). For an ALLOW decision, _call_tool consults _over_snapshot_quota (service.py:298). That function returns False whenever _needs_snapshot is False. For write_file, _needs_snapshot runs sandboxes.exists(), an untimed `test -e` exec inside the agent's own container (service.py:236 -> sandbox.py:458-461). The ALLOW branch then calls _needs_snapshot a second time (service.py:343) and commits on that result without checking the quota again (service.py:345 -> _snapshot -> sandbox.py:355). If the target path appears between the two probes, an over-quota call that should have become REQUIRE_APPROVAL/snapshot-quota becomes an unapproved commit. The agent can make the path appear in two ways. (a) It sends an allowlisted exec `touch <path>` (default_policy.yaml:22-29; touch is on line 27) at the same time as the write. exec is not in SNAPSHOT_TOOLS (service.py:35), so call_tool does not serialize it with the write_file under _snap_locks (service.py:278-285); tool_concurrency allows 4 concurrent calls. (b) Any process running in the container toggles the path. Within one sandbox, _snap_locks only serializes write_file, delete_file and GUI_INPUT calls against each other. The pending-approval cap (PENDING_APPROVALS_MAX=20) does not stop the bypass: it only blocks the REQUIRE_APPROVAL branch. Each commit is a full docker commit of the container (sandbox.py:355-356). config.py:44-46 records why the quota exists: commit copies the whole writable layer, and the quota keeps the agent from filling host disk without a human. Snapshot images are freed only when the sandbox is deleted (sandbox.py:327-332). The marginal harm depends on deployment. With AGENTBOX_DISK set (storage_opt, sandbox.py:263-264), the writable layer is bounded and the quota is the only bound on how many copies of that layer are kept, so the bypass multiplies it without limit. With the default empty AGENTBOX_DISK (config.py:41-42), the agent can already grow the writable layer directly through repeated unapproved write_file calls (1 MiB each, config.py:55), so the bypass mainly adds amplification. Local reproduction used the real AgentBox._call_tool/call_tool, Policy.load(default_policy.yaml), AuditLog and ApprovalStore with a fake SandboxManager. Its exists() stats a real file with a modelled 20 ms probe latency, and exec touch has a modelled 20 ms latency. No Docker was used. Results with the sandbox already at quota=2: a control call on a stably existing path returned 202 pending snapshot-quota with 0 commits. Concurrent agent exec `touch /workspace/pN` started 5 ms before, together with, or 5 ms after write_file gave 20/20 write_file calls returning 200 executed with a snapshot commit each, 0 approvals and policy_decision allow (an offset of -10 ms gave 18/20; -15 ms gave 0/20). A real background thread toggling the file every 2-20 ms produced 9 over-quota commits in 40 calls (7 in an earlier run), alongside 20 pending approvals.",
 "claimed_root_cause": "_call_tool reads the same mutable, agent-controlled container state twice: once in _over_snapshot_quota through _needs_snapshot/sandboxes.exists (service.py:298 -> 248 -> 236), then again in the pre-execution _needs_snapshot (service.py:343). It does not compute one 'snapshot needed' decision and bind both the quota gate and the commit to it. The quota therefore guards only the first probe, and the commit at service.py:345 has no quota check of its own. The serialization in _snap_locks covers only SNAPSHOT_TOOLS, so agent tools outside that set (exec) and processes inside the container can change the probed state between the two reads.",

# Phase 5 procedure (verbatim)

```text
### Phase 5: Verify the final records with fresh eyes

Launch one fresh `research` verifier per final `confirmed` and `needs_validation` record, in parallel. This verifier checks the structured record, not the hunter write-up, and remains inside source/local boundaries.

In a `quick` run, Phase 3 and Phase 5 merge: the Phase 3 verifier also performs these record checks and returns the final schema-shaped record, so each candidate gets one fresh independent reviewer instead of two. Every other profile keeps the two passes separate. Never skip independent review of a `confirmed` record in any profile.

For `confirmed`, require it to check:

1. Every repository-relative trace/evidence path, line, scope, and described operation.
2. Real entry interface and exact local input shape.
3. Every condition, parser/policy step, source-visible preventing layer, and observed local result.
4. Affected principal/resource and demonstrated impact.
5. Severity separation: realistic likelihood, demonstrated impact, overall no greater than impact.
6. Remediation strategy and any `code_changes`, including whether the fix enforces the invariant without merely moving trust.

For `needs_validation`, require it to check:

1. The source path is real and supports only the `claimed_root_cause` stated.
2. Every listed blocker is decisive and not already answerable locally.
3. The candidate names a boundary and a possible concrete result rather than a generic concern.
4. At least one validation-plan field is present and exact. `local` uses a bounded fixture; `deployment` asks an owner to observe a configuration, identity, route, policy, or runtime fact. Do not invent a plan for an inapplicable context, and never send audit traffic to a deployment.
5. The fingerprint matches prior/current records for the same root cause.

Each verifier returns exactly one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"..."}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`, with no surrounding prose. A replacement record must match its `confirmed`, `needs_validation`, or `rejected` schema branch. Treat a malformed or prose-wrapped Phase 5 result the same way as in Phase 3: discard it without repairing it and re-run with a fresh verifier when the budget permits.

Do not apply a Phase 5 replacement as final when it promotes a record to a stronger verdict, including any promotion to `confirmed`, or materially changes the root cause, trace, execution input or observed result, demonstrated impact, or severity. Give that complete replacement to a new independent verifier that did not hunt, perform Phase 3 validation, or propose the Phase 5 replacement. The new verifier rechecks the current source and independently reproduces any decisive local result under the execution boundary, then returns `verified` or another replacement. Apply a material replacement only after this fresh verification. If another material replacement results, repeat with a fresh verifier. If budget or independence is unavailable, remove the disputed record from `findings.json`, keep its ledger unit as an unresolved candidate, and set `run_status: "incomplete"` with an exact `incomplete_reason`. Non-material wording or repository-line corrections may be applied directly when they do not change meaning or evidence.

After every applied replacement, rerun both validators and update linked ledger decisions. If a final verifier identifies a separate root cause, assign a new fingerprint and send it through independent candidate validation before inclusion. Set `run_status: "complete"` only when every ledger candidate has an independent final disposition and every retained record passes Phase 5.

Do not verify only `confirmed` records. A misleading `needs_validation` handoff wastes owner time and can preserve a false premise.

# Architecture facts (summary; re-check every line you rely on)

# agentbox architecture summary (run-4)

Source ref: `9805d91` (`main`, after refactor PRs #11-#14). Profile `standard`, whole repo, budget 50. Built from recon-1a..1d (`agents/recon-*/result.md`). Line numbers below were re-checked by the parent; recon-1b and recon-1c cite some `api.py`, `web.py` and `preview.py` lines that do not exist in this tree, so treat their numbers as approximate.

## 1. Product, principals, protected resources

agentbox is a self-hosted FastAPI + SQLite control plane. It gives AI agents Docker sandboxes, routes risky tool calls through a human approval queue, and keeps a hash-chained audit log. Desktop templates add Xvfb/Xfce/x11vnc/noVNC so a human can watch or take over the screen.

- **Human token** `hum_…` (one shared admin secret, `config.py:88-100`): full JSON API (`api.py:115` `principal`).
- **Browser cookie session**, scope `*` (login form or one-time `*` ticket): full UI. Sessions and tickets carry a `gen` fingerprint of the human token, so rotation revokes them (`desktop.py`).
- **Desktop-link session**, scope = one sandbox id: only that sandbox's desktop page/state/takeover/handback/WS (`api.py:157` `desktop_human`).
- **Agent token** `agt_…` per sandbox (hash stored): tools on its own sandbox, read own sandbox/approval/desktop state. Lowest-trust network principal; the threat model assumes a prompt-injected agent.
- **Code inside the sandbox**: uid 1000 `agent` (exec, file tools) and uid 1001 `desktop` (X session, GUI tools, x11vnc; in the agent group). Every container output (exec stdout, `ps`, `xdotool`, `find -printf` manifest, outbox listing, `ls`, preview `_expand`/`_walk`, screenshot bytes, RFB stream) is attacker data to the control plane.
- **Unauthenticated network clients**: `/`, `/login` (GET/POST; failed POST writes an audit row), `/static/htmx.min.js`, `/static/novnc/*` (`api.py:356`, may create a container via `extract_novnc`), `/healthz`, ticket redemption, FastAPI `/docs`.
- **MCP stdio server / `agent.py` loop**: hold an agent token; trust the local launcher.

Protected resources: the human token and approval authority; host filesystem and Docker daemon (the control plane holds `docker.sock` = host root); other sandboxes; `/workspace` restore points (snapshots before destructive actions and per GUI burst); audit-log integrity and secret masking; control-plane availability (thread pools, memory, SQLite, host disk via `docker commit`).

## 2. Comparable baseline

No source-grounded comparable product. Components: MCP (FastMCP/MCPServer stdio), RFB via x11vnc `-inetd` + socat + noVNC, gVisor/Kata named as preferred runtimes. A runc sandbox shares the host kernel.

## 3. Stack, deployment, offline limits

Python ≥3.11; fastapi, uvicorn, websockets, jinja2, docker SDK, pyyaml, mcp. Modes: `agentbox serve` (127.0.0.1 default; `bind_problem` and `runtime_problem` gates, `cli.py:68-111`; `runtime_problem` rejects only the literal `"runc"`), compose + Caddy with `--behind-tls-proxy` and `forwarded_allow_ips="*"` by default (`cli.py:124-126`), and the bare `create_app` factory (`api.py:376`) that skips the serve-time gates. Container flags (`sandbox.py:243-265`): `network_mode=none`, non-recursive read-only `/source` bind, `cap_drop ALL` + CHOWN/DAC_OVERRIDE/FOWNER/SETUID/SETGID, no-new-privileges, mem/cpu/pids limits, no userns, default seccomp. The desktop start script resets `/home/desktop` on every start and restore (v19 fix).

Host for this run: Docker 29.9.1, runtimes `runc`/`io.containerd.runc.v2` only, cgroup v1, images `ubuntu:24.04`, `buildpack-deps:noble-curl`, `agentbox-desktop:0.1` (rebuilt from this tree). Agent-run code goes through `tools/sbx` (no network, read-only target, 256 MiB loop scratch, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 64 pids, 120 s; `agentbox.web`/`api` importable). Docker-free tests: `tests/test_unit.py`, `test_m2_unit.py`, `test_m4_unit.py`; fakes for `GuiBursts`/`AgentBox` in `test_m2_unit.py`. Anything needing the real daemon is a parent-live check.

## 4. Entry surfaces and important paths

- **Tools**: `POST /sandboxes/{sid}/tools/{tool}` → `AgentBox.call_tool` (`service.py:268`, per-sandbox concurrency 4, `_snap_locks`) → `_call_tool` (`service.py:290`: audit with capped args `_logged_args:181` → `policy.decide` → quota → approval or `_snapshot:250` → `_run_tool`) on the 32-thread `tool_pool` (`api.py:103`). Pending approvals capped at 20 (`service.py:44`).
- **Approvals**: `POST /approvals/{aid}` / `POST /ui/approvals/...` (human) → `decide` (`service.py:389`): atomic claim, snapshot, run stored args. Runs on the Starlette threadpool, outside `tool_pool`, `_busy` and `_snap_locks`. Preview (`preview.py:67` `preview_command` with `_expand`/`_walk` callbacks, `sandbox.py:557-569`) and capture run before the approval exists.
- **Lifecycle** (refactor PR 1): `pause_sandbox/resume_sandbox/snapshot_sandbox/restore_sandbox/delete_sandbox` (`service.py:444-475`), called by `api.py` and `web.py` inside `guard`. Restore: log → `end_desktop` → `sandboxes.restore` → `bursts.reset_timers` → log. Delete: log → `end_desktop` → delete → `drop_captures`. Pause: log → `bursts.end` → pause. None takes `gui_lock` or `_snap_locks`.
- **GUI bursts** (`gui_bursts.py:23`, refactor PR 2): `needs_snapshot:52`, `open:65` (fail-closed baseline, bound to `container_id`), `close:100`/`_finish:113` (stray kill via `gui_state.gui_strays` from root `ps` + `_NET_WM_PID`, manifest diff → `gui_changes`), `close_idle:137` on a dedicated pool from `expire_stale` callers, `end:157`. Timestamps `_gui_input_at`/`_gui_snap_at` are written without a lock.
- **Desktop**: tickets (60 s, one-time, hashed), sessions (12 h, scoped), leases; takeover/handback (`service.py:503,523`, `bursts.close` under `gui_lock`); WS route `api.py:344` (cookie, `same_origin` with missing Origin allowed, mode, `may_connect`) → `desktop_ws.relay:18` (no auth of its own; session re-check every 30 s; x11vnc without `-noremote`/`-safer`).
- **Files**: `read_file`/`write_file`/`delete_file`/`list_dir` (`safe_path`), upload, outbox list/read; `list_dir`, `exists`, `is_dir`, `outbox_list`, `_expand` run `exec_run` with no container-side timeout and full buffering.
- **Rendering**: Jinja autoescape + `finalize=_shown` → `display.escape_controls:18` (shared with `cli._safe`); `_NoFraming` middleware (`api.py:63`) on HTTP responses.
- **Audit**: hash chain + append-only triggers, `mask_text`; `log_human` fails closed with 503 (`service.py:590`); tool results and burst records are best-effort.

## 5. Trust boundaries and strongest control

| Boundary | Strongest control |
|---|---|
| Agent → host/other sandboxes | container hardening + runtime (runc on this host) |
| Agent → approval gate (exec) | `policy.simple_programs` allowlist + `has_bash_comment` + `>`/`$` gate |
| Agent → approval gate (GUI) | none by design; burst snapshot, fail-closed open, `gui_changes`, stray kill (N-1 partial) |
| Agent → human authority | token kinds, `human_only`, scope checks, `samefile` source_dir overlap check |
| Agent → control-plane availability | `tool_pool`, tool concurrency, `_Head`, snapshot quota, pending cap, `_timed` X/manifest execs |
| Container output → control plane | `_parse_ps`, `_parse_manifest`, `_parse_outbox`, preview parsing; masking; escaping |
| Browser → UI | SameSite=Strict HttpOnly cookie, `same_origin`, XFO/frame-ancestors |
| Desktop-link session → rest of UI | `scope`, `desktop_human` |
| Network → control plane | `bind_problem`; proxy trust `*`; unauthenticated login/novnc routes |

## 6. Starting paths

`agentbox/service.py`, `gui_bursts.py`, `gui_state.py`, `sandbox.py`, `sandbox_desktop.py`, `sandbox_common.py`, `preview.py`, `api.py`, `desktop_ws.py`, `web.py`, `display.py`, `desktop.py`, `policy.py`, `audit.py`, `approvals.py`, `cli.py`, `config.py`, `mcp_server.py`, `agent.py`, `default_policy.yaml`, `templates/`, `images/desktop/`, `deploy/`.

## 7. Prior coverage and revalidation

Prior ledgers: run-1 (`7fc501f`) and run-3 (`0e4b958`/`8e4db9e`, incomplete, 29 units); run-2 validated run-1 live. Every run-3 confirmed record (11) was fixed and the refactor moved the code, so all are `prior_confirmed_changed_source` revalidation units, not hunter exclusions. Five run-3 `needs_validation` records (v01 same_origin scheme, v09 burst open, v10 gui_lock, v14 framing, v15 `gui_strays` window ownership) are current work. Three critic-3 units deferred in run-3 (GUI-burst state races, disk/SQLite pressure, pre-auth work) are current work. Two rejected claims (runc alias, backgrounded-children pid exhaustion) suppress only those exact claims. No same-source confirmed exclusions. Recon-flagged seams: lifecycle methods without `gui_lock`/`_snap_locks`, `decide` outside the snapshot lock, synchronous burst closes on human threads, unbounded/untimed preview and listing execs, error/preview strings that bypass the audit arg cap, unauthenticated audit growth, x11vnc remote-control plus `from_exec` stray exemption, root `/tmp` operations in the desktop start script.

## Core discipline (include in every agent prompt for this domain)

```
- Require an input-to-cost path, a missing effective bound, and impact on another user, shared service, safety function, or operator-owned spend. Self-limiting work in the requester's own process is not a service vulnerability.
- A missing rate limit is not enough. Check body/message/file caps, concurrency, queues, deadlines, database constraints, upstream gateways, and per-tenant quotas before calling a path unbounded.
- Do not run stress, saturation, or production tests. Use asymptotic analysis, small boundary fixtures, mocked paid calls, strict local resource limits, and deterministic cancellation tests.
- State attacker cost, service work, persistence, scope, and recovery. One bounded input with superlinear or persistent shared effect is materially different from sustained volume.
- Use `confirmed` for source-visible bounds failures demonstrated safely. Use `needs_validation` when upstream caps, deployed topology, autoscaling, paid quota, or recovery behavior is outside the repository.
```

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Quota-accounting scope and reset gaps -->
**Quota-accounting scope and reset gaps**
Accounting uses attacker-influenceable IP, route, tenant, key prefix, task ID, or other dimension, allowing one principal's work to escape its intended budget or consume another principal's allocation. Review integer overflow, distributed races, retries, reconnects, and account switching.

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Universal moves -->
## Universal moves (apply across the above)

- Build an input-to-resource table: earliest accepted size/cardinality, work before auth, downstream fan-out, persistence, shared pool, limit and cleanup owner, recovery.
- Compare aggregate limits with per-object limits. Ten thousand valid one-byte items may evade a per-message cap while exhausting tenant-wide or process-wide state.
- Validate only in an isolated fixture with strict CPU/memory/time limits and small growth points. Mock external and paid calls and stop once the missing bound or cancellation is observable.

<!-- RESOURCE-EXHAUSTION-AND-AVAILABILITY.md#Validation rules -->
## Validation rules (apply before reporting ANY finding here)

1. Name untrusted input, requester work, service amplification or retained resource, shared blast radius, and recovery. Missing limits without concrete shared impact are hardening.
2. Confirm no source-visible upstream, parser, queue, tenant, or framework bound prevents the path. Unknown deployed controls require `needs_validation`.
3. For superlinear behavior, establish the accepted complexity and bounded local growth. For leaks, show repeatable retention after cleanup should occur. For fatal paths, identify process/supervisor isolation.
4. Prioritize by low requester work, unauthenticated reachability, cross-tenant scope, persistence, and poor recovery; do not validate with availability impact.
5. Return `confirmed` only with safe local proof and meaningful shared effect. Return `needs_validation` with the exact upstream limit, topology, quota, or recovery observation an owner must check.

# Execution boundary and paths

- Agent ID `r13`. Write ONLY in `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/agents/r13/scratch/`. Never edit target files, the ledger, findings, architecture or another agent's directory.
- Run target-controlled code only through `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/tools/sbx r13 <cmd...>`: audited source read-only at /target (on PYTHONPATH), scratch at /scratch, no network, no Docker socket, uid 65534, 512 MiB, 1 CPU, 64 pids, 32 MiB files, 120 s. Use `/usr/bin/python3.13`.
- Unit tests need cwd=/target: `/home/user/agentbox/docs/security-audit/run-4/tools/sbx r13 /usr/bin/sh -c "cd /target && /usr/bin/python3.13 -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider --capture=sys -q tests/test_unit.py"`.
- If you produce a local artifact, list it in a top-level `"artifacts_to_promote": [...]` field (scratch-relative, <=256 KiB each). The parent promotes it after you finish.
- Your final message must be ONLY one JSON object: `{"decision":"verified","fingerprint":"agentbox/service.py:snapshot-quota:toctou-between-quota-gate-and-pre-exec-snapshot"}` or `{"decision":"replace","reason":"...","record":{...}}`. No prose, no code fence.
